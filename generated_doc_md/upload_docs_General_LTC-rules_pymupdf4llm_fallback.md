The undersigned is directed to say that the Government of India have had under
consideration the question of rationalising and simplifying the procedure regulating the

recommendations, Government have decided that the existing Leave Travel Concession
Scheme for Central Government servants, as amended from time to time, shall be modified
to the extent indicated below with immediate effect:—

of the Office instead of by the Controlling Officer.


(iii) Where the shortest route by which the journey is required to be performed is
disrupted due to accidents or other causes, the power to grant reimbursement
by the actual route travelled may be exercised by the Controlling Authority,
instead of by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, in
consultation with Ministry of Finance (Department of Expenditure) as at present.

the increasing competition and the air travel schemes of various airlines offering
significant discounts on normal fares, in order to enable economy in undertaking air
travel, without in any way taking away the existing entitlements:(i) The basic criteria for selecting airlines other than Indian Airlines/Air India
would be better and more competitive prices being offered by he other
airlines.
(ii) Various incentive schemes and concessional fares offered by Indian
Airlines/Air India will also be fully utilized.

class, should endeavour to take advantage of the concessions being
provided by the airlines, to effect possible savings vis-à-vis the normal
fares.

possible, so that benefits of discounted fares can be obtained. However,
the official work should not be deferred because discounted fares are not
available.

entitled class offered by Indian Airlines/Air India or their subsidiaries.

would require a credit card through which payments can be made.
Reimbursement of service charge expenses on such credit card would be
permissible.

also be availed. However, this would need one time prior approval of the
