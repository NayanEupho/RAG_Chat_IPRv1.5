basis. With the exception of such book
adjustments as may be authorised by

comprises the following sections:
‘Receipt Heads (Revenue Account)’
dealing with the proceeds of taxation and
other receipts classified as revenue and
the section ‘Expenditure Heads
(Revenue Account)’ dealing with the
revenue expenditure met therefrom. The
Capital Division comprises three
sections, viz., ‘Receipt Heads (Capital
Account)’, ‘Expenditure Heads (Capital
Account)’ and ‘Public Debt, Loans and
Advances, etc.’. These sections are in
turn divided into sectors such as ‘General
Services’, ‘Social and Community
Services’, ‘Economic Services’, etc.,
under which specific functions or services
are grouped corresponding to the sectors
of classification and which are
represented by Major Heads (comprising
Sub-Major Heads wherever necessary).

**Government Accounts.** As a general
rule, classification of transactions in

Major Heads (comprising Sub-Major
Heads wherever necessary) are divided
into Minor Heads. Minor Heads may have
a number of subordinate heads, generally

are further divided into Detailed Heads
followed by Object Heads.
The Major Heads of account, falling
within the sectors for expenditure heads,
generally correspond to functions of
Government, while the Minor Heads

achieve the objectives of the functions
represented by the Major Head. The Sub
Head represents schemes, the Detailed
Head denotes sub scheme and Object
Head represent the primary unit of

nature of expenditure such as salaries
and wages, office expenses, travel
expenses, professional services, grantsin-aid, etc. The above six tiers are

**V.** **CAPITAL AND REVENUE ACCOUNTS**

**Rule 98** **Capital** **Expenditure.** Significant



22


expenditure incurred with the object of
acquiring tangible assets of a permanent
nature (for use in the organisation and not
for sale in the ordinary course of
business) or enhancing the utility of
existing assets, shall broadly be defined
as Capital expenditure. Subsequent,
charges on maintenance, repair, upkeep
and working expenses, which are
required to maintain the assets in a
running order as also all other expenses
incurred for the day to day running of the
organisation, including establishment
and administrative expenses, shall be
classified as Revenue expenditure.
Capital and Revenue expenditure shall
be shown separately in the Accounts.
Expenditure on a temporary asset or on
grants-in-aid cannot ordinarily be
considered as a capital expenditure and
shall not, except in cases specifically
authorised by the President on the advice
of the Comptroller and Auditor General of
India, be debited to a Capital Head.
Capital expenditure is generally met from
receipts of capital nature, as
distinguished from ordinary revenues
derived from taxes, duties, fees, fines and
similar items of current income including
extraordinary receipts. It is open to the
Government to meet capital expenditure
from ordinary revenues, provided there
are sufficient revenue resources to cover
this liability.
Expenditure of a Capital nature as
defined above, shall not be classed as
Capital expenditure in the Government
Accounts unless the classification has
been expressly authorised by general or
special orders of Government.
Expenditure of a Capital nature shall be
distinguished from the Revenue
Expenditure both in the Budget Estimates
and in Government Accounts.
**Rule99** **Principles** **for** **allocation** **of**
**expenditure** **between** **Capital** **and**
**Revenue.** The following are the main
principles governing the allocation of
expenditure between Revenue and
Capital:
(a) Capital shall bear all charges for
the first construction and
equipment of a project as well as
charges for intermediate
maintenance of the work while
not yet opened for service. It shall
also bear charges for such
further additions and
improvements, which enhance
the useful life of the asset, as
may be sanctioned under rules
made by competent authority.



(b) Subject to Clause (c) below,
revenue shall bear subsequent
charges for maintenance and all
working expenses. These
embrace all expenditure on the
working and upkeep of the
project and also on renewals
and  replacements  and
additions, improvements or
extensions that are revenue in
nature as per rules made by
Government.
(c) In the case of works of renewal
and replacement, which partake
expenditure both of a capital and
revenue nature, the allocation of
expenditure shall be regulated by
the broad principle that Revenue
should pay or provide a fund for
the adequate re- placement of all
wastage or depreciation of
property originally provided out of
capital grants. Only the cost of
genuine improvements, which
enhance the useful life of the
asset whether determined by
prescribed rules or formulae, or
under special orders of
Government, may be debited to
Capital. Where under special
orders of Government, a
Depreciation or Renewals
Reserve Fund is established for
renewing assets of any
commercial department or
undertaking, the distribution of
expenditure on renewals and
replacements between Capital
and the Fund shall be so
regulated as to guard against
over-capitalisation on the one
hand and excessive withdrawals
from the Fund on the other.
(d) Expenditure on account of
reparation of damage caused by
extraordinary calamities such as
flood, fire, earthquake, enemy
action, etc., shall be charged to
Capital, or to Revenue, or divided
between them, depending upon
whether such expenditure results
in creation/acquisition of new
assets or whether it is only for
restoring the condition of the
existing assets, as may be
determined by Government
according to the circumstance of
each case.
(e) Expenditure on a temporary
asset cannot ordinarily be
considered as a capital
expenditure and shall not, except



23


in cases specifically authorised
by the President on the advice of
the Comptroller and Auditor
General of India, be debited to a
Capital Head.
**Rule 100** **Allocation** **between** **capital** **and**
**revenue expenditure:** The allocation
between capital and revenue expenditure
on a Capital Scheme for which separate
Capital and Revenue Accounts are to be
kept, shall be determined in accordance
with such general or special orders as
may be prescribed by the Government
after consultation with the Comptroller
and Auditor General of India.
**Rule101** **Capital receipts during construction**
**mainly to be utilised in reduction of**
**capital expenditure:** Capital receipts in
so far they relate to expenditure
previously debited to Capital accruing
during the process of construction of a
project, shall be utilised in reduction of
capital expenditure. Thereafter their
treatment in the accounts will depend on
circumstances, but except under special
rule or order of Government, they shall
not be credited to the revenue account of
the department or undertaking.
**Rule 102** **Receipts and recoveries representing**
**recoveries of expenditure previously**
**debited** **to** **Capital** **Major** **Head:**
Receipts and recoveries on Capital
Account in so far as they represent
recoveries of expenditure previously
debited to a Capital Major Head shall be
taken in reduction of expenditure under
the Major Head concerned except where,
under the rules of allocation applicable to
a particular department, such receipts
have to be taken to Revenue.
**Rule 103** **Conversion of outstanding loans into**
**equity investments or grants-in-aid.**
Government takes from time to time,
suitable measures to strengthen/
restructure the Capital base of public
sector enterprises so that these
enterprises can improve their
performance and productivity. As a part
of the package scheme, financial relief in
the form of conversion of outstanding
loans into equity investments or grantsin-aid are also agreed to.
Where loans outstanding against Public
Sector Undertakings are proposed to be
converted into equity investments in or as
grants-in-aid to the Public Sector
Undertakings, the approval of the
Parliament to such proposals, shall be
obtained by including a token provision in
the relevant Demands for Grants or
Supplementary Demands for Grants as
may be found expedient. The details of



such conversion of loans may be
explained in the relevant
Budget/Supplementary Demand
documents. After obtaining the approval
of the Parliament, the balances under
loans and the progressive expenditure of
the Capital Heads of Accounts shall be
corrected proforma in the relevant
Accounts of the Union Government,
under the Loan/Capital Major Heads
concerned.

**VI.** **INTEREST ON CAPITAL**

**Rule 104** **Interest rate.** Except in special cases
regulated by special orders of
Government, interest at such rates as
may be specified from time to time shall
be charged in the accounts of all
Commercial Departments or units for
which separate capital and revenue
accounts are maintained within the
Government accounts.
**Rule 105** **(1) Charging of interest on capital**
**outlay met out of specific loans raised**
**by Government.** For capital outlay met
out of specific loans raised by
Government, the interest shall be
charged at such rate as may be
prescribed by Government, having
regard to the rate of interest actually paid
on such loans and the incidental charges
incurred in raising and managing them.
By specific loans are meant loans that are
raised in the open market for one specific
purpose which is clearly specified in the
prospectus and in regard to which definite
information is given at the time of raising
of the loans.
**Rule 105** **(2)** For capital outlay provided otherwise,
interest shall be charged at the rate of
interest to be determined each year by
the Department of Economic Affairs,
Ministry of Finance.
**Rule 106** **Method of calculation of interest.** The
interest shall be calculated on the direct
capital outlay at the end of the previous
year plus half the outlay of the year itself,
irrespective of whether such outlay has
been met from current revenues or from
other sources.
**Rule 107** **How interest charged to capital is to be**
**written back.** When under any special
orders of Government, charges for
interest during the process of
construction of a project are temporarily
met from capital, the writing back of
capitalised interest shall form the first
charge on any capital receipts or surplus
revenue derived from the project when
opened for working.

**VII.** **ADJUSTMENT WITH GOVERNMENT**
**DEPARTMENTS ETC**

**Rule 108** Adjustments with State Governments.
Subject to the relevant provision of the
Constitution or of law made by Parliament
or any orders issued thereunder,
adjustments in respect of financial
transactions with State Governments
shall, unless otherwise provided for, be
made in such manner, and to such extent
as may be mutually agreed upon
between the Central Government and the
State Government concerned. However,
adjustments with State Government in
respect of the matters mentioned below
shall be regulated by the rules contained
in Appendix-5 to the Government
Accounting Rules, 1990. The rules are
based on reciprocal arrangements made
with the State Governments and are,
therefore, binding on all of them: (i) Pay and Allowances, other than
Leave Salaries.
(ii) Leave Salaries.
(iii) Pensions.
(iv) Expenditure involved in Audit and
keeping Accounts.

**rendered not to be preferred.** The
Central Government (which includes



Union Territories) and the State

reciprocal arrangement mentioned
above, will be that the claim shall be both
petty and of an occasional character and
shall cover services rendered and not
supplies made unless the latter forms
part of service. The term “service
rendered” will be taken to mean an
individual act of service, like providing
police escort to a high dignitary and will
not apply to supply of stores etc. Claims
relating to Commercial undertakings
under the Government of India or the
State Governments such as those of the
Railways, the Department of Post, the
Electrical undertakings, etc., shall fall
outside the purview of the proposed
reciprocal arrangements and shall
continue to be settled as hitherto.
If a doubt arises as to whether a particular
claim would fall within or outside the
purview of the proposed arrangement, it
shall be decided by mutual consultation.
The above arrangements will remain in
force without any time limit in respect of
all State Governments.
**Rule 113** **Projects jointly executed by several**
**State Governments.** In the case of
Projects, jointly executed by several
Governments, where the expenditure is
to be shared by the participating
Governments in agreed proportions, but
the expenditure is ab-initio incurred by
one Government and shares of other
participating Governments recovered
subsequently; such recoveries from other
Governments shall be exhibited as
abatement of charges under the relevant
expenditure Head of Account in the
books of the Governments incurring the
expenditure initially
**Rule 114** **Claims of State Governments on**
**account of the extra cost of agency**
**functions.** Claims of State Governments,
on account of the extra cost of agency
functions entrusted to them under Article
258 of the Constitution shall be dealt with

**Rule 115** The following principles shall be generally
observed in dealing with claims preferred



25


by State Governments under Clause (3)
of Article 258 of the Constitution: —
(i) If the agency work involves the
employment of a State
Commercial Department, it would
be open to that department to
charge its normal commercial
costs.
(ii) Public Works Department
agency costs shall be
represented by such percentage
charges on the cost of Central
Works executed by the State as
may be agreed between the
Central and the State
Government concerned, works
outlay being treated as an
amount placed at the disposal of
the State Government for actual
expenditure on the execution of
the work.
(iii) The cost of regular joint
establishment shall be shared as
far as practicable on the basis of
fixed annual sums settled in
agreement with the State
Government concerned.
(iv) In other cases, the following
procedure shall be adopted
unless there are special orders to
the contrary:(a) Details of claims preferred
by State Governments
shall be ascertained.
(b) If the work has been
performed by the State
Government in the past,
the charges shall be
compared with those
charged in the past but it is
not necessary to be
meticulous in the matter.
(c) If the charges are found to
be reasonable and do not
exceed Rupees Fifty
thousand per annum for
any individual item (or
connected group of items),
a five years contract shall
be offered to the State
Government during which
the Central Government
would pay the fixed sum
per annum for the work.
The amount will be
subjected to review at the
end of each period of five
years.
(d) If the amount agreed upon
exceeds Rupees Fifty
thousand, it shall be
necessary to have an



annual statement of
proposed charges from the
State Government at the
time of preparation of the
Budget. However, if in any
individual case, the
charges are obviously
static, then the contract
system may be adopted in
these cases also.
(v) In exceptional cases in which
arbitration has to be resorted to,
the Ministry of Finance will make
the requisite arrangement in the
matter.
(vi) The Ministry of Finance shall be
consulted on all matters arising
under Article 258 (3) of the
Constitution.
**Rule 116** **Principles governing transactions in**
**connection with the agency functions**
**entrusted to State Government.** The
following procedure shall be followed in
regard to transactions arising in
connection with the agency functions
entrusted to the State Governments
under Article 258 of the Constitution:
(i) **The expenditure on extra staff**
**or contingencies which the**
**State Government have to**
**incur-** The extra cost to the State
Government arising mainly in
respect of the additional staff
employed or contingent and
other expenditure, as in the case
of work devolving on the State
Governments in connection with
the administration of the Census
Act, is reimbursable under Article
258 (3) of the Constitution.
Expenditure in this regard shall
be provided in the State Budget
in the first instance and adjusted
in the accounts of the State
Governments under the normal
Heads of Accounts. These will be
reimbursed in lumpsum to the
State Governments, necessary
provision being made under a
distinct sub-head ”Amounts paid
to other Governments,
Departments, etc.”, under the
concerned Demand of the
Ministry administratively
concerned with the subject. In
computing the extra cost, the
element of leave and pensionary
charges can also be included,
provided the relevant service and
financial rules of the State
Governments provide for this.



26


(ii) **The** **expenditure** **on** **work**
**entrusted** **to** **the** **State**
**Government,** **such** **as**
**expenditure on construction**
**and maintenance of National**
**Highways,** **expenditure** **on**
**Defence** **Works,** **Aviation**
**Works,** **etc.-** The expenditure
directly connected with the
execution of the scheme or work
entrusted to the State
Government such as expenditure
on the construction or
maintenance of National
Highways etc., will be adjusted
direct in the accounts of the
Central Government under the
relevant Head of Account. The
question of including the
estimates in this regard in the
Budget of the State Governments
and subjecting them to the vote
of the State Legislature will not
arise. The expenditure will be
adjusted under the Head “8658 –
Suspense Accounts –PAO
Suspense” in the Remittance
Section of the State Accounts in
the first instance pending their
eventual clearance in
accordance with the prescribed
procedure.
**Note:** In the converse case relating to the
entrustment of a State function to the
Central Government under Article258-A
of the Constitution, a procedure similar to
that indicated in the Rule 116 above shall
be followed. The extra cost on staff and
other contingent expenditure, etc., will
accordingly have to be provided in the
Budget of the Central Government in the
usual manner and recovery made in
lumpsum from the State Government
concerned. The other expenditure on
execution of the work proper should be
debited to the State Government
concerned directly and the question of
obtaining a vote of the Parliament for the
same will not arise.
**Rule 117** **Crucial date for closure of Inter-**
**Governmental** **adjustments.** InterGovernmental adjustments can be
carried out upto the _10th of April or the_
_date as specified by office of Controller_
_General of Accounts in consultation with_
_Reserve Bank of India from time to_
_time_ _[[1A]]_ on which date the books of the
Reserve Bank are closed for the month of
March. Every endeavour must,

therefore, be made to settle as far as
possible all transactions with State
Governments before the close of the
year.

**Rule 118** **Adjustments** **with** **foreign**
**Governments, outside bodies, etc.**
Unless exempted by Government by
general or special orders, services shall
not be rendered to any foreign
Government or non-Government body or
institution or to a separate fund
constituted as such except on payment.
**Rule 119** **Recoveries of expenditure for services**
**rendered to non-Government parties.**
Recoveries of expenditure for services
rendered or supplies made to nonGovernment parties or other
Governments (including local funds and
Governments outside India), shall in all
cases, be classified as receipts of the
Government rendering such services.
**Rule 120** **Recoveries of expenditure for services**
**rendered** **as** **an** **agent.** When a
Government undertakes a service merely
as an agent of a private body, the entire
cost of the service shall be recovered
from that body so that the net cost to
Government is nil. The recoveries shall
be taken as reduction of expenditure.
**Explanation:** The term ‘recovery’ is used
in these rules to denote repayment of, or
payment by non-Government parties or
other Governments towards charges
initially incurred and classified by a
Central Government Department in the
account, as final expenditure by debit to
a Revenue or Capital Head of Account.
Recoveries towards establishment
charges, tools and plants, fees for
procurement of inspection of stores or
both etc., effected at percentage rates or
otherwise, are some examples.
**Rule 121** **Payments to outside body or fund to**
**be through grant-in-aid.** Any relief in
respect of payment for services rendered
or supplies made to any outside body or
fund shall ordinarily be given through a
grant-in-aid rather than by remission of
dues.
**Rule 122** **Charges relating to the maintenance**
**and demarcations and disputes over**
**boundaries.** The incidence of charges
relating to the maintenance and
demarcations and disputes over
boundaries between India and a
foreigncountry is regulated by the
following principles;
(i) Maintenance           - Half the
maintenance charges will be



27


borne by the Central
Government, the other half being
recovered, as far as practicable,
from the foreign country, failing
which the foreign country’s share
will also be borne by the Central
Government.
(ii) Demarcation and Disputes –
Charges relating to demarcation
of boundaries and boundary
disputes will be borne by the
Central Government under Entry
10 of the Union List, subject to
such recovery as shall be made
from the Foreign Country.
(iii) Where streams or other
watercourses form the
boundaries and where the
ordinary principle of median line
applies, the Government
concerned (i.e., Foreign Country
or India) will bear the cost of
maintenance of the boundary line
on its side. Where a separate set
of survey marks is maintained by
each of the two Governments on
its side, the cost of maintenance
of the survey marks shall be
borne by the Government
concerned.
**Exception:**
(a) The arrangement in (i)
above in its application to
Nepal will be subject to
special arrangements
worked out in consultation
with the Nepal Government.
(b) The share of the Bhutan

Government for
maintenance and
demarcation of and disputes
over boundaries will be
borne by the Central
Government for the present

**VIII.** **INTER-DEPARTMENTAL**
**ADJUSTMENTS**

**Rule 123** **Inter-Departmental Adjustments.** Save
as expressly provided by any general or
special orders, a Service Department
shall not charge other Departments for
services rendered or supplies made
which falls within the class of duties for
which the former Department is
constituted. However, a commercial
Department or undertaking shall
ordinarily charge and be charged for any
supplies made and services rendered to,
or by, other departments of Government.
**Rule 124** **Principles for division of Departments**
**for purposes of inter-departmental**



**payments.** For purposes of interDepartmental payments, the
Departments of a Government shall be
divided into service Departments and
commercial departments according to the
following principles: (i) Service Departments-These are
constituted for the discharge of
those functions which either (a) Are inseparable from and

form part of the idea of
Government e.g.
Departments of
Administration of Justice,
Jails, Police, Education,
Medical, Public Health,
Forest, Defence; or
(b) Are necessary to, and form

part of, the general conduct
of the business of
Government e.g.
Departments of Survey,
Government Printing,
Stationery, Public Works
(Building and Roads
Branch), Central Purchase
Organisation (DirectorGeneral of Supplies and
Disposals, New Delhi).
(ii) Commercial Departments or
Undertakings.- These are
established mainly for the
purposes of rendering services or
providing supplies, of certain
special kinds, on payment for the
services rendered or for the
articles supplied. They perform
functions, which are not
necessarily governmental
functions. They are required to
work to a financial result
determined through accounts
maintained on commercial
principles.
**Rule 125** **Period for preferment of claims.** All
claims shall ordinarily be preferred
between Departments, both commercial
and non-commercial of the Central
Government, within the same financial
year and not beyond three years from the
date of transaction. This limitation,
however, may be waived in specific
cases by mutual agreement between the
departments concerned.
**Rule 126** **Procedure for settlement of inter-**
**departmental** **adjustments.** The
settlement of inter- departmental
adjustments shall be regulated by the
directions contained in Chapter 4 of
Government Accounting Rules, 1990.
**Rule 127** **Inter-departmental** **and** **other**
**adjustments to be made in the account**



28


**year.** Under the directions contained in
the Account Code for Accountants
General, Inter-departmental and other
adjustments are not to be made in the
accounts of the past year, if they could
not have been reasonably anticipated in
time for funds being obtained from the
proper authority. In all cases, where the
adjustment could have reasonably been
anticipated as, for example, recurring
payments to another Government or
department and payments which, though
not of fixed amount, are of a fixed
character, etc., the Accounts Officer will
automatically make the adjustment in the
accounts before they are finally closed.
The onus of proving that the adjustments
could not have been reasonably
anticipated should lie with the Controlling
Officer.
As between different Departments of the
same Government, the recoveries
effected for services rendered shall be
classified as deductions from the gross
expenditure. However, recoveries made
by a Commercial Department, e.g.,
Railways, Posts or a departmental
commercial undertaking in respect of
services rendered in pursuance of the
functions for which the Commercial
Department is constituted shall be treated
as receipts of the Department but where
it acts as an agent for the discharge of
functions not germane to the essential
purpose of the Department, the
recoveries shall be taken as reduction of
expenditure.
**Exception-** Recoveries of fees for
purchase, inspection, etc., effected by the
Central Purchase Organizations of
Government of India, are treated as
receipts of the Department concerned.
**NOTE 1.** -The term ‘recovery’ is used in
this rule to denote repayment of/or
payment by one Department of the same
Government towards charges initially
incurred and classified by another
Department in its accounts as final
expenditure by debit to a Revenue or
Capital Head of Account. Recoveries
towards establishment charges, tools and
plants, fees for procurement or inspection
of stores or both, etc., effected at
percentage rates or otherwise, are some
examples.
**NOTE** **2.** -Recoveries effected from
another Department of the same
Government which are to be classified as
deduction from the gross expenditure,
shall be shown in the relevant Demand
for Grant as “below the line” recovery
under the appropriate Major Head of



Account etc. Recovery actually effected,
irrespective of the year to which it relates
shall be adjusted in accounts in the
schedule of recovery to be attached to
the Appropriation Account of the year in
which the recovery is affected.

**Rule 128** **Adjustment of Pensionary Charges of**
**certain** **Commercial** **Departments.**
Except as otherwise provided, the
pensionary liability of commercial
departments and undertakings, for which
pro forma commercial accounts are
maintained, shall be assessed on a
contribution basis at such rates as may
be fixed by Government from time to time.
In the case of departments and
undertakings, for which no regular
commercial accounts are maintained
either within or outside the regular
Government accounts but which are
allowed to charge for their products or
services rendered, the pensionary liability
shall be taken into account in the
estimate of overhead charges and
manufacturing costs for the purpose of
calculating the issue price of goods
manufactured or fees for services
rendered. The calculation shall be made
at rates prescribed for the purpose by
Government.
**NOTE:** The Railways, Posts and Defence
Departments are regarded as separate
Governments for the purpose of
adjustment of pensionary charges.
**Rule 129** Pensionary liability in the case of
Government Departments / Undertakings
declared as commercial. In the case of
Government Departments and
Undertakings declared as commercial,
adjustment of Pensionary liability shall be
made in the regular accounts by charging
the average of the percentage for 15th
year of service based on the rates of
monthly contribution of pension as
prescribed in the appropriate order
issued from time to time under AppendixII of Fundamental and Supplementary
Rules.

41


the subject goods. Such
maintenance contracts are especially
needed for sophisticated and costly
equipment and machinery. It may,
however, be kept in mind that the
equipment or machinery is
maintained free of charge by the
supplier during its warranty period or
such other extended periods as the
contract terms may provide and the
paid maintenance should commence
only thereafter.
**Rule 170 Bid Security**

(i) To safeguard against a bidder's
withdrawing or altering its bid
during the bid validity period in
the case of advertised or limited
tender enquiry, Bid Security
(also known as Earnest Money)

bidders except Micro and Small
Enterprises (MSEs) as defined in
MSE Procurement Policy issued
by Department of Micro, Small

Industry and Internal Trade
(DPIIT)] [33] . The bidders should
be asked to furnish bid security
along with their bids. Amount of
bid security should ordinarily
range between two percent to
five percent of the estimated
value of the goods to be
procured. The amount of bid
security should be determined
accordingly by the Ministry or
Department and indicated in the
bidding documents. The bid
security may be accepted in the
form of [Insurance Surety
Bonds] [34] Account Payee
Demand Draft, Fixed Deposit
Receipt, Banker's Cheque or

that if they withdraw or modify
their Bids during the period of
validity, or if they are awarded
the contract and they fail to sign
the contract, or to submit a

eligible to submit Bids for
contracts with the entity that
invited the Bids.
**Rule 171 Performance Security**

(i) To ensure due performance of
the contract, Performance
Security is to be obtained from
the successful bidder awarded
the contract. Unlike contracts of
Works and Plants, in case of
contracts for goods, the need
for the Performance Security
depends on the market
conditions and commercial
practice for the particular kind
of goods. Performance Security,

firms against fabrication
contracts, turn-key contracts
etc.
Such advance payments should
not exceed the following limits:

contract value to private
firms;

(b) Forty per cent. of the

contract value to a State or
Central Government agency
or a Public Sector

**fairness** **and** **elimination** **of**
**arbitrariness in the procurement**
**process** All government purchases
should be made in a transparent,
competitive and fair manner, to
secure best value for money. This will
also enable the prospective bidders to
formulate and send their competitive
bids with confidence. Some of the
measures for ensuring the above are
as follows:(i) the text of the bidding
document should be selfcontained and comprehensive
without any ambiguities. All
essential information, which a
bidder needs for sending

for the score of quality of the
technical proposal and the score
of financial proposal.

(iii) The RFP shall specify the

minimum qualifying score for
the quality of technical proposal
and also the relative weight
ages to be given to the quality
and cost (determined for each
case depending on the relative
importance of quality vis-a-vis
cost aspects in the assignment,
e.g. 70:30, 60:40, 50:50 etc).
The proposal with the highest
weighted combined score
(quality and cost) shall be
selected.
(iv) The weight age of the technical

parameters i.e. non- financial
parameters in no case should
exceed 80 percent.
**Rule 193 Least Cost System (LCS).** LCS is

(i) tasks that represent a natural
continuation of previous work
carried out by the firm;
(ii) in case of an emergency
situation, situations arising after
natural disasters, situations
where timely completion of the
assignment is of utmost
importance; and

(iii) situations where execution of
the assignment may involve use
of proprietary techniques or
only one consultant has
requisite expertise.

(iv) Under some special
circumstances, it may become
necessary to select a particular
consultant where adequate
justification is available for such
single-source selection in the
context of the overall interest of
the Ministry or Department. Full
justification for single source
selection should be recorded in
the file and approval of the
competent authority obtained
before resorting to such singlesource selection.

(v) It shall ensure fairness and
equity, and shall have a
procedure in place to ensure
that the prices are reasonable
and consistent with market
rates for tasks of a similar
nature; and the required
consultancy services are not
split into smaller sized
procurement.
**Rule 195 Monitoring the Contract.** The

Ministry/Department should be
involved throughout in the conduct
of consultancy, preferably by taking
a task force approach and



continuously monitoring the
performance of the consultant(s) so
that the output of the consultancy is

**CH-8 CONTRACT MANAGEMENT**


**Rule 224 (1)** All contracts shall be made by an

authority empowered to do so by or
under the orders of the President in
terms of Article 299 (1) of the
Constitution of India.
**Rule 224 (2)** All the contracts and assurances

of property made in the exercise of
the executive power of the Union
shall be executed on behalf of the
President. The words "for and on
behalf of the President of India"
should follow the designation
appended below the signature of the
officer authorized in this behalf.
**Note 1:** The various classes of
contracts and assurances of property,
which may be executed by different
authorities, are specified in the
Notifications issued by the Ministry of
Law from time to time.
**Note 2:** [The powers of various
authorities, the conditions under
which such powers should be
exercised and the general procedure
prescribed with regard to various
classes of contracts and assurances
of property are laid down in [Rule 11]
of the Delegation of Financial Powers
Rules.] [51]
**Rule 225 General principles for contract.**

The following general principles
should be observed while entering
into contracts:—
(i) The terms of contract must be
precise, definite and without
any ambiguities. The terms
should not involve an uncertain
or indefinite liability, except in
the case of a cost plus contract
or where there is a price
variation clause in the contract.
(ii) Standard forms of contracts
should be adopted wherever
possible, with such
modifications as are considered
necessary in respect of
individual contracts. The
modifications should be carried
out only after obtaining financial
and legal advice.
(iii) In cases where standard forms
of contracts are not used, legal
and financial advice should be

taken in drafting the clauses in
the contract.
(iv)
(a) A Ministry or Department
may, at its discretion,
make purchases of value
up to Rupees two lakh
and fifty thousand by
issuing purchase orders
containing basic terms
and conditions:
(b) In respect of Works
Contracts, or Contracts
for purchases valued
between Rupees one lakh
to Rupees ten lakhs,
where tender documents
include the General
Conditions of Contract
(GCC), Special Conditions
of Contract (SCC) and
scope of work, the letter
of acceptance will result
in a binding contract.
(c) In respect of contracts for
works with estimated
value of Rupees ten lakhs
or above or for purchase
above Rupees ten lakhs,
a Contract document
should be executed, with
all necessary clauses to
make it a self-contained
contract. If however,
these are preceded by
Invitation to Tender,
accompanied by GCC and
SCC, with full details of
scope and specifications,
a simple one page
contract can be entered
into by attaching copies
of the GCC and SCC, and
details of scope and
specifications, Offer of
the Tenderer and Letter
of Acceptance.
(d) Contract document
should be invariably
executed in cases of
turnkey works or
agreements for
maintenance of
equipment, provision of
services etc.
(v) No work of any kind should be



58


commenced without proper
execution of an agreement as
given in the foregoing
provisions.
(vi) Contract document, where
necessary, should be executed
within 21 days of the issue of
letter of acceptance. Nonfulfilment of this condition of
executing a contract by the
Contractor or Supplier would
constitute sufficient ground for
annulment of the award and
forfeiture of Earnest Money
Deposit.
(vii) Cost plus contracts should
ordinarily be avoided. Where
such contracts become
unavoidable, full justification
should be recorded before
entering into the contract.
Where supplies or special work
covered by such cost plus
contracts have to continue over
a long duration, efforts should
be made to convert future
contracts on a firm price basis
after allowing a reasonable
period to the
suppliers/contractors to
stabilize their production/
execution methods and
processes.
**Explanation:** A cost plus contract

means a contract in which the
price payable for supplies or
services under the contract is
determined on the basis of
actual cost of production of the
supplies or services concerned
plus profit either at a fixed rate
per unit or at a fixed percentage
on the actual cost of production
(viii)

(a) Price Variation Clause can
be provided only in longterm contracts, where
the delivery period
extends beyond 18
months. In short-term
contracts firm and fixed
prices should be provided
for. Where a price
variation clause is
provided, the price
agreed upon should
specify the base level viz,
the month and year to
which the price is linked,



to enable variations being
calculated with reference
to the price levels
prevailing in that month
and year.
(b) A formula for calculation
of the price variations
that have taken place
between the Base level
and the Scheduled
Delivery Date should be
included in this clause.
The variations are
calculated by using
indices published by
Governments or
Chambers of Commerce
periodically. An
illustrative formula has
been appended to these
rules at Appendix -11 for
guidance.
(c) The Price variation clause
should also specify cut off
dates for material and
labour, as these inputs
taper off well before the
scheduled Delivery
Dates.
(d) The price variation clause
should provide for a
ceiling on price
variations, particularly
where escalations are
involved. It could be a
percentage per annum or
an overall ceiling or both.
The buyer should ensure
a provision in the
contract for benefit of
any reduction in the price
in terms of the price
variation clause being
passed on to him.
(e) The clause should also
stipulate a minimum
percentage of variation of
the contract price above
which price variations will
be admissible (e.g. where
resultant increase is
lower than two per cent,
no price adjustment will
be made in favour of the
supplier).
(f) Where advance or stage
payments are made there
should be a further
stipulation that no price



59


variations will be
admissible on such
portions of the price,
after the dates of such
payment
(g) Where deliveries are
accepted beyond the
scheduled Delivery Date
subject to levy of
liquidated damages as
provided in the Contract,
the liquidated damages
(if a percentage of the
price) will be applicable
on the price as varied by
the operation of the Price
variation clause.
(h) No price variation will be
admissible beyond the
original Scheduled
Delivery Date for defaults
on the part of the
supplier.
(i) Price variation may be
allowed beyond the
original Scheduled
Delivery Date, by specific
alteration of that date
through an amendment
to the contract in cases of
Force Majeure or defaults
by Government.
(j) Where contracts are for
supply of equipment,
goods etc, imported
(subject to customs duly
and foreign exchange
fluctuations) and/or
locally manufactured
(subject to excise duty
and other duties and
taxes), the percentage
and element of duties
and taxes included in the
price should be
specifically stated, along
with the selling rate of
foreign exchange
element taken into
account in the calculation
of the price of the
imported item.
The mode of calculation
of variations in duties and
taxes and foreign
exchange rates and the
documents to be
produced in support of
claims for such variations



should also be stipulated
in the Contract.
(k) The clause should also
contain the mode and
terms of payment of the
price variation
admissible.
(ix) Contracts should include
provision for payment of all
applicable taxes by the
contractor or supplier.
(x) "Lump sum” contracts should
not be entered into except in

including the scope and
specification once

be materially varied.
(b) Wherever material
variation in any of the
terms or conditions in a

unavoidable, the financial
and other effects
involved should be
examined and recorded
and specific approval of
the authority competent
to approve the revised
financial and other
commitments obtained,
before varying the
conditions.
(c) All such changes should
be in the form of an
amendment to the
contract duly signed by
all parties to the contract.

(ix) **Peer review of autonomous**
**organisations:** Ministry shall put
in place a system of external or
internal peer review of
autonomous organisations every
three or five years depending on
the size and nature of activity.
Such a review should be the
responsibility of the concerned
administrative division of the
Ministry/Department and should
focus, inter alia, on;
(a) the objective for which the

autonomous organisation
was set up and whether
these objectives have been
or are being achieved;
(b) whether the activities should

be continued at all, either
because they are no longer
relevant or have been
completed or if there has
been a substantial failure in
achievement of objectives.
(c) whether the nature of the

activities is such that these
need to be performed only
by an autonomous
organisation.
(d) whether similar functions

are also being undertaken
by other organisations, be it
in the Central Government
or State Governments or the
Private Sector, and if so,
whether there is scope for
merging or winding up the
organisations under review.

complement, particularly at
the support level, is kept at a
minimum: whether the
enormous strides in
information technology and
communication facilities as
also facilities for outsourcing
of work on a contract basis,
have been taken into
account in determining staff
strength; and whether
scientific or technical
personnel are being
deployed on functions which
could well be carried out by
non-scientific or nontechnical personnel etc.

organization so that the
dependence upon
Government budgetary
support is minimised.
(x) An organisation whose
performance is found to be
outstanding and internationally
acclaimed as a result of the
review envisaged under Para (ix)
above should be granted greater
autonomy and increased
flexibility in matters of recruitment
and financial rules thereby
enabling it to devise and adopt
staff structures, procedures and
rules suited to improving their
productivity.
(xi) Autonomous organisations as
also others with a budgetary
support of more than Rupees five
crores per annum, should be
required to enter in to a
Memorandum of Understanding
with the Administrative Ministry
or Department, spelling out
clearly performance parameters,
output targets in terms of details
of programme of work and
qualitative improvement in
output, along with commensurate
input requirements. The output
targets, given in measurable
units of performance, should
form the basis of budgetary
support extended to these
organisations. The roadmap for
improved performance with clear
milestones should form part of
the MoU.
(xii) Findings of the peer review
should be examined and put up
for appropriate decision to the
Secretary by the concerned
programme division of the
Administrative Department.
Further releases of Grant (after
three or five years, as the case
may be), should be made
conditional on conduct and
decisions on the findings of such
peer review.
**Rule230** **(1) Principles and Procedure for award**
**of Grants-in-aid.**
Any Institution or Organisation seeking
Grants-in-aid from Government will be



64


required to submit an application which
includes all relevant information such as
Articles of Association, bye-laws, audited
statement of accounts, sources and
pattern of income and expenditure etc.
enabling the sanctioning authority to
assess the suitability of the Institution or
Organisation seeking Grant. The
application should clearly spell out the
need for seeking Grant and should be
submitted in such form as may be
prescribed by the sanctioning authority.
The Institution or Organisation seeking
Grants-in-aid should also certify that it
has not obtained or applied for grants for
the same purpose or activity from any
other Ministry or Department of the
Government of India or State
Government.
**Rule 230** **(2)** In order to obviate duplication in
Grants-in-aid, each Ministry or
Department should maintain a list of
institutions or organisations along with
details of amount and purpose of Grants
given to them. These details should also
be made available on the website of the
Ministry/Department.
**Rule 230** **(3)** Award of Grants should be considered
only on the basis of viable and specific
schemes drawn up in sufficient detail by
the institution or organisation. The budget
for such schemes should disclose, inter
alia, the specific quantified and qualitative
targets likely to be attained against the
outlay. In the cases of the schemes
where Grants are given as part of the
expenditure on reimbursement basis (i.e.
the expenditure has already been
incurred on approved project/scheme
and reimbursement from the Government
in the form of Grant/Subsidy etc. is due)
the same will be treated as the Central
Financial Assistance (CFA) and no
Utilization Certificate shall be required in
such cases of reimbursements.
**Rule 230** **(4)** Recurring Grant is defined as one
which is released periodically to the same
organization for the same purpose. Nonrecurring Grant is one time release to an
organization for a special purpose (which
could be released in installments). Every
order sanctioning a Grant shall indicate
whether it is recurring or non-recurring
and specify clearly the object for which it
is being given and the general and
special conditions, if any, attached to the
Grant. In the case of non-recurring
Grants for specified object, the order shall
also specify the time limit within which the
Grant or each installment of it, is to be
spent.



**Rule 230** **(5)** Central Autonomous Organisations
which receive Grants should account for
capital and revenue expenditure
separately. The Government of India,
Ministry of Finance has formulated
standard formats for presentation of final
accounts, for all Central Autonomous
Organisations. All Grant sanctioning
authorities should enforce the condition
of maintaining and presenting their
annual accounts in the standard formats
on all Central Autonomous
Organisations.
**Rule 230** **(6)** The Grants sanctioning authorities
should not only take into account the
internally generated resources while
regulating the award of Grants but should
consider laying down targets for internal
resources generation by the Grantee
Institutions or Organisations every
financial year, particularly where Grants
are given on recurring basis every year.
**Rule 230** **(7) Unspent Balances:** When recurring
Grants-in-aid are sanctioned to the same
Institution or Organisation for the same
purpose, the unspent balance of the
previous Grant should be taken into
account in sanctioning the subsequent
Grant. For this purpose, the Programme
Division of Ministries/Department shall
take help of PFMS Portal to know the
bank balance of the recipients before
making each release. The instructions of
Department of Expenditure regarding the
use of PFMS Portal for Central Sector
Schemes issued from time to time shall
be strictly followed by all Ministries/
Departments. The principles of ‘just in
time release’, should be applied for
releases in respect of all payments to the
extent possible. The following broad
principles shall be adhered to:
(i) Cash balance at a time should
preferably not be more than 3
months of requirements
(ii) Funds should be released as per
actual requirements and that
sanction may precede the
release of funds, though its
validity may be limited to that
financial year.
**Rule 230** **(8)** All interests or other earnings against
Grants in aid or advances (other than
reimbursement) released to any Grantee
institution should be mandatorily remitted
to the Consolidated Fund of India
immediately after finalisation of the
accounts. Such advances should not be
allowed to be adjusted against future
releases.



65


**Rule 230** **(9)** In making Grants to Non-Government
or Quasi-Government Institutions or
Organisations, a condition should be laid
down that assets acquired wholly or
substantially out of Government Grants,
except those declared as obsolete and
unserviceable or condemned in
accordance with the procedure laid down
in the General Financial Rules, shall not
be disposed of without obtaining the prior
approval of the authority which
sanctioned the Grants-in-aid.
**Rule 230** **(10)** The sanctioning authority may
prescribe conditions regarding quantum
and periodicity for release of Grants-inaid in installments in consultation with the
Financial Adviser. However, the release
of the last installment of the Annual Grant
must be conditional upon the Grantee
Institutions providing reasonable
evidence of proper utilization of
installments released earlier. In the cases
where Central Financial Assistance
(CFA) has been sanctioned, the grant will
be released in one installment upon the
Grantee Institutions/ Organisation
providing complete evidence of achieving
the specified objectives and expenditure
incurred supported by Audited Statement
of Expenditure. In these cases, the
grantee institutions will not be required to
submit Utilization Certificates.
**Rule 230** **(11)** In order to finalize the Budgetary
Estimates of Grants in aid to the Grantee
Institutions, the Ministry or Department
should impress upon Institution or
Organisation desiring Grants from
Government, to submit their requirement
with supporting details by the end of
September in the year preceding the year
for which the Grants-in-aid is sought. The
Ministry or Department should finalize
their examination of the requests with the
utmost expedition and make the
necessary Budget provision where it is
decided to sanction Grants. The
Institution or Organisation should be
informed of the result of their requests by
April of the succeeding year.
**Rule 230** **(12)**
(i) All Grantee Institutions or
Organisations which receive
more than fifty percent of their
recurring expenditure in the form
of Grants-in- aid, should
ordinarily formulate terms and
conditions of service of their
employees which are, by and
large, not higher than those
applicable to similar categories of
employees in Central
Government. In exceptional



cases relaxation may be made in
consultation with the Ministry of
Finance.
(ii) Grantee Institutions or
Organisations should be
encouraged to take advantage of
the pension or gratuity schemes
or Group Insurance Schemes or
house buildings loans or vehicle
loans schemes etc. available in
the market for employees instead
of undertaking liability on their
own or Government account.
**Rule 230** **(13)** The sanctioning authority, while
laying down the pattern of assistance,
may decide whether the ownership of
buildings constructed with Grants-in-aid
may vest with Government or the
Grantee Institution or Organisation.
Where the ownership is vested in the
Government, the Grantee Institution or
Organisation may be allowed to occupy
the building as a lessee. In such cases
suitable record of details of location, cost,
name of lessee and terms & conditions of
lease must be maintained in the records
of the granting Ministry or Department. In
all cases of buildings constructed with
Grants-in-aid, responsibility of
maintenance of such buildings shall be of
the Grantee Institution or Organisation.
**Rule 230** **(14)** Any other special terms and
conditions or procedures for transaction
of business as Government may desire to
be followed by the Grantee Institution or
Organisation, shall be got incorporated in
the Articles of Association or bye-laws of
the Institution or Organisation concerned
before release of Grants-in-aid.
**Rule 230** **(15)** Grants-in-aid may be sanctioned to
meet the bonafide expenditure incurred
not earlier than two years prior to the date
of issue of the sanction.
**Rule 230** **(16)** The stipulation in regard to refund of
the un-utilised amount of Grant-in-aid
with interest thereon should be brought
out clearly in the letter sanctioning the
Grant as well as in the bond so required
to be executed.
**Rule 230** **(17)** (i) As a precondition to the sanction
of Grants-in-aid to the agencies where:

(a) the recipient body employs

more than twenty persons on
a regular basis and at least
fifty per cent of its recurring
expenditure is met from
Grants-in-aid from Central
Government; and
(b) the body is a registered

society or a co-operative
institution and is in receipt of a
general purpose annual



66


Grants-in-aid of Rupees
twenty lakhs and above from
the Consolidated Fund of
India;
(c) the Grant sanctioning
authority should ensure that a
suitable clause is invariably
included in the terms and
conditions under which the
Grants-in-aid are given, to
provide for reservation for
Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes or OBC in
posts and services under
such organizations or
agencies. The relative
provision may be on the
following lines: “ … … … … … (Name of
Institution or Organization
etc.)agrees to make
reservations for Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes
or OBC in the posts or
services under its control on
the lines indicated by the
Government of India”.
(ii) While sanctioning Grants-in
aid to Institutions or
Organisations referred to in
(a) above, the Grant
sanctioning authority should
keep in view the progress
made by such Institutions or
Organisations in employing
Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes or OBC
candidates in their services.
**Rule 231** **(1)** **Grants-in-aid** **to** **“Voluntary**
**Organisations”** Subject to the following
terms and conditions, Grants-in-aid
towards administrative expenditure may
be sanctioned to voluntary organizations
to ensure a certain minimum staff
structure and qualified personnel to
improve their effectiveness and expand
their activities under the following
conditions: (i) The Grants-in-aid should not
exceed twenty-five percent of
approved administrative
expenditure on pay and
allowances of the personnel of
the voluntary organisation
concerned;
(ii) Grants-in-aid to meet
administrative expenditure to any
private institutions other than the
voluntary organizations should
not ordinarily be sanctioned. In
exceptional cases such Grants
can be considered for sanction in



consultation with Internal
Finance Wing.
**Rule 231** **(2)** Before a Grant is released, the
members of the Executive Committee of
the Grantee should be asked to Execute
Bonds in a prescribed format binding
themselves jointly and severally to:(i) abide by the conditions of the
Grants- in-aid by the target dates,
if any, specified therein; and
(ii) not to divert the Grants or entrust
execution of the scheme or work
concerned to another
Institution(s) or Organization(s);
and
(iii) abide by any other conditions
specified in the agreement
governing the Grants-in-aid.
(iv) In the event of the Grantee failing
to comply with the conditions or
committing breach of the
conditions of the Bond, the
signatories to the Bond shall be
jointly and severally liable to
refund to the President of India,
the whole or a part amount of the
Grant with interest at ten percent
per annum thereon or the sum
specified under the Bond. The
stamp duty for this Bond shall be
borne by the Government.
**Rule 231** **(3)** Execution of Bond will not apply to
Quasi - Government Institutions, Central
Autonomous Organisations and
Institutions whose budget is approved by
the Government
**Rule 232** **General** **Principles** **for** **award** **of**
**Grants-in-aid for Centrally Sponsored**
**Schemes.** The following principles
should be kept in view by
Ministries/Departments of the Central
Government at the time of designing
Centrally Sponsored Schemes for
implementation in State Governments or
Union Territories and approving and
releasing assistance to State
Governments or Union Territories for
such schemes: (i) Every Centrally Sponsored
Scheme should haveatimebound quantifiable and
measurable outcome targets with
provisions for periodic
monitoring, mid-term evaluation
and detailed impact studies.
(ii) The scheme should be designed
in consultation with States and
Union Territories. States should
be delegated adequate powers to
change the details of the
schemes to suit local conditions,
subject to reporting such



67


changes to the concerned
Ministry or Department.
(iii) Where schemes are in operation
with similar objectives targeting
the same population, the
schemes should be converged.
(iv) To ensure monitoring and
effective control over such
schemes, the number of
schemes should be restricted, so
that the gain from the
expenditure on such schemes is
maximized. The role of the
Central Ministries or
Departments should be capacity
building, inter-sectoral
coordination and detailed
monitoring.
(v) The release of funds to State
Governments and monitoring
further utilisation should be
undertaken through PFMS. The
Ministries or Departments should
establish a mechanism to ensure
that the funds earlier released
have been effectively utilised and
that the data and facts reported
by the State Governments or
Union Territories relating to
physical and financial
performance are correct. Before
releasing further funds, it should
also be ensured that the State
Governments or Union
Territories have the capacity to
actually spend the balance from
the previous years and the
releases during the current year.
(vi) The Ministries or Departments
should focus attention on the
attainment of the objectives and
not on expenditure only. A
mechanism for avoiding release
of large part of funds towards the
end of the year should be
devised and incorporated in the
Scheme design itself.
(vii) A concurrent monitoring and
evaluation mechanism should be
built into the Scheme. A periodic
review of every Centrally
Sponsored Scheme should be
undertaken for any required midcourse correction or changes in
the scheme design
(viii) A post-completion review of
every Centrally Sponsored
Scheme should be undertaken
by the State Government(s) or
Union Territories implementing
the scheme, highlighting the time
and cost overruns, if any, and



suggestions for formulating and
implementing future schemes. A
copy of the review should be
obtained by the Ministry
concerned and kept in view while
formulating new Centrally
Sponsored Schemes.
**Rule 233** **Funding of Sponsored Projects or**
**Schemes.**
(i) Ministries or Departments of
Government sponsor projects or
schemes to be undertaken by
Universities, Indian Institute of
Technology and other similar
Autonomous Organisations such
as ICAR, CSIR, ICMR etc., the
results from which are expected
to be in national interest.
Normally the entire expenditure
on such projects or schemes
including capital expenditure, is
funded by the Ministry or
Department. The funds released
for such projects or schemes in
one or more installments are not
treated as Grants-in-aid in the
books of the implementing
agency. Apart from the
requirement of submission of
technical and financial reports on
completion of the project or
scheme, a stipulation should be
made in such cases that the
ownership in the physical and
intellectual assets created or
acquired out of such funds shall
vest in the sponsor. While the
Project or Scheme is ongoing,
the recipients should not treat
such assets as their own assets
in their Books of Accounts but
should disclose their holding and
using such assists in the Notes to
Accounts specifically.
(ii) On completion of the Projects or
Schemes and the receipt of
technical and financial reports,
the Ministries/Departments
should decide and communicate
to the implementing agencies
whether the assets should be
returned, sold or retained by
them.

[ **Note:** In relaxation of the extant
provisions of the rule, Scientific
Departments are allowed to
extend the provisions of Rule 233
(i) & (ii) to private sector / NGOs
who are commissioned to



68


execute projects or schemes.] [54]
(iii) If the assets are to be sold, the
proceeds therefrom should be
credited to the account of the
sponsoring Department /
Organisation. If the assets are
allowed to be retained by the
Institution/ Organisation, the
implementing agency should
include the assets at the book
value in their own accounts.
**Rule 234** **Register of Grants.** A Register of Grants
shall be maintained by the sanctioning
authority in the format given in Form GFR

        - 21.
(i) Columns (i) to (v) of the Register
in format at Form GFR - 21
should be filled in simultaneously
with the issue of the order
sanctioning each Grant. These
columns should be attested by
any Gazetted Officer nominated
for the purpose by the
sanctioning authority. The serial
number should be recorded on
the body of the sanction at the
time the item is entered in the
Register as under: “Noted at
Serial No …………………… in
the Register of Grants”.
(ii) Such a record will guard against
the possibility of double payment.
Columns (vi) and (vii) should be
filled in and attested by the
Gazetted Officer concerned as
soon as the bill is ready. The bill
should then be submitted to the
Gazetted Officer nominated to
act as Drawing and Disbursing
Officer with the register for
signing the bill and to the
sanctioning authority for giving
dated initials in column (viii) of
Register. It should also be the
duty of the sanctioning authority
to verify that the conditions, if
any, attached to the Grant have
been duly accepted by the
Grantee without any reservation
and that no other bill for the same
purpose has already been paid
before. No bill should be signed
unless it has been noted in the
Register of Grants against the
relevant sanction. This will also
facilitate watching of payments in
installments, if any, in the case of
lump sum sanctions.

(iii) Information at column (xiii) of the
Form GFR-21 above should be

**Rule 235** **Accounts of Grantee Institutions.**
Institutions or Organisations receiving
Grants should, irrespective of the amount
involved, be required to maintain
subsidiary accounts of the Government
grant and furnish to the Accounts Officer
a set of audited statement of accounts.
These audited statements of accounts
should be required to be furnished after
utilization of the Grants-in-aid or
whenever called for.
**Rule 236** **(1) Audit of Accounts.** The accounts of
all Grantee Institutions or Organisations
shall be open to inspection by the
sanctioning authority and audit, both by
the Comptroller and Auditor General of

institutions and other Government
bodies.
**Rule 247** **(1)Powers and Procedure for sanction**
**of loans.** The powers of Departments of
the Central Government and
Administrators as well as other
subordinate authorities to sanction loans
are given in the Delegation of Financial
Powers Rules and other general and
special orders issued under that rule.
**Rule247** **(2)Nodal** **Division** **in** **Ministry** **of**
**Finance.** The Budget Division,
Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry
of Finance shall be the nodal division in
the Ministry of Finance to finalise terms
and conditions of loans by the Central
Government.
**Rule 248** All sanctions of loans issued by a
Department of Central Government or an
Administrator of Union Territory in
exercise of their powers under the
relevant provision of Delegation of
Financial Powers Rules shall include a
certificate to the effect that the same is in
accordance with the rules or principles
prescribed by the Ministry of Finance and
that the rate of interest on the loan and
the period of repayment thereof have
been fixed with the approval of that
Ministry.
**Rule 249** **(1)** All sanctions to loans shall be subject
to the Delegation of Financial Powers
Rules and shall specify the terms and
conditions relating to them including the
terms and conditions of their repayment
and payment of interest.
**Rule 249** **(2)** Borrowers shall be required to adhere
strictly to the terms settled for the loans
made to them. Modifications of these
terms can be made subsequently only for
very special reasons and after seeking
prior concurrence of Ministry of Finance.
**Rule 250** **(1) General conditions for regulating**
**all loans :** All loans shall be regulated by
the following general conditions :(i) A specific term shall be fixed
which shall be as short as
possible, within which each loan
has to be fully repaid with interest
due. The terms may, in very
special cases, extend to thirty
years.
(ii) The term is to be calculated from



the date on which the loan is
completely drawn or declared by
competent authority to be closed.
(iii) The repayment of loans shall be
effected by installments, which
shall ordinarily be fixed on annual
basis, and with due dates of
payment being specially
prescribed.
(iv) Any installment paid before its
due date may be taken entirely
towards the principal, provided it
is accompanied by payment
toward interest due up-to-date of
actual payment of installment; if
not, the amount of the installment
shall first be adjusted towards the
interest due for preceding and
current periods and the balance,
if any, shall alone be applied
towards the principal. If,
however, the payment of the
installment is in advance of the
due date by fourteen days or
less, interest for the full period
(half-year or full year, as the case
may be) shall be payable.
(v) When the due date of repayment
of any installment of principal or
interest falls on a Sunday or a
public holiday, the payment
made on the next working day
following the Sunday or the
public holiday, shall be regarded
as payment on the due date and
no interest shall be charged for
the day or days by which the
recovery is so postponed.
**Exception.** If an installment of
principal or interest is payable on
the thirty-first March of a year,
and if that day happens to be a
public holiday the recoveries
shall be made on the immediately
preceding working day. In case,
the due date for the repayment of
a loan or payment of interest falls
on a holiday observed by the
Reserve Bank of India, at which
the effective credit of the same is
to take place this shall be shifted
to the next working day, except
when the due date is thirty-first
March.
(vi) The payment of interest and the
repayment of principal of a loan
are always to be made with
reference to the calendar date on
which the loan in question is paid.
However, where payment of
installment is in advance of the
due date by fourteen days or



74


less, interest for the full year or
half year (depending on the
prescribed mode of recovery)
shall be charged thereon. In the
case of a loan sanctioned by the
Central Government to a State
Government on or before thirtyfirst March of a year, which is
adjusted in the books of the
Reserve Bank of India in the
month of April but in the accounts
of the previous year the
installment of principal and/or
interest shall fall due for payment
on the thirty- first March of the
succeeding year and not on the
anniversaries of the calendar
date in April on which the interGovernmental adjustment was
carried out.
(vii) The date of drawal of a loan by a
State Government shall be
determined as indicated below –
(a) **When** **monetary**
**settlement** **is** **involved-**
Normally the calendar date
on which amount of a loan is
actually credited to the
account of the State
Government by the Reserve
Bank is to be treated as the
date of its drawal.
This position shall also hold
in cases where adjustment
in accounts is made in one
month but date of
adjustment in the books of
the Reserve Bank of India
falls in the following
calendar month. The
calendar date on which the
credit is actually afforded to
the State Government in the
books of the Reserve Bank
of India in such cases shall
be treated as the date of its
drawal.
**Exception.** An exception to
this arrangement is in the
case of loans for which
credit is afforded to the
recipient State Government
in the month of April by the
Reserve Bank of India but in
the accounts of previous
year. In such cases, a loan
shall be deemed to have
been paid on the thirty-first
March of the financial year in
the accounts for which the
payment is adjusted.
Consequently, payment of



annual interest as also
repayment of installment of
principal in respect of such
loans shall fall due on the
thirty-first March of the
succeeding years and not
on the anniversaries of the
calendar date in April on
which inter- Governmental
adjustment on account of
such loans was carried out
in the books of the Reserve
Bank of India.
(b) **Where** **no** **monetary**
**settlement is involved.** In
regard to cases where
adjustment in the books of
the Accounts Offices are
only involved and actual
credit through the Reserve
Bank of India is not
necessary, the last date of
the month of account in
which the adjustment is
effected shall be taken as
the date of drawal of loan for
purposes of repayment and
charging interest.
(viii) In order to avoid any default in
the payment of loan, the Principal
Accounts Officers or Pay and
Accounts Officers who maintain
the detailed accounts of loans,
shall issue notices in Form GFR19 to the loanees (other than
State and Union Territory
Governments) i.e. Public Sector
Undertakings, statutory bodies
and Government institutions etc.,
say, a month in advance of the
due date for the repayment of
any instalment of the principal
and/ or interest thereon.
However, omission to give notice
does not give the loanees any
claim to exemption from the
consequences of default in the
repayment of the principal and/or
interest thereon.
**Rule 250** **(2)** Before sanctioning a loan to private
Institutions the lending Ministry or
Department shall examine the financial
health and managerial ability of such
institutes.
**Rule 250** **(3)** (i) Before considering a loan
application from parties other than State
Governments and Local Administrations
of Union Territories, the following
requirements shall be fulfilled:
(a) it shall be seen that there is

adequate budget provision;
(b) it shall be seen whether the



75

accordance with approved
Government policy and
accepted patterns of
assistance.

offered by an independent
authority and a certificate to
the effect that the asset
offered as security is not
already encumbered.
(d) Details of loan or loans taken

from the Central Government
or a State Government in the
past, indicating amount,
purpose, rate of interest,
stipulated period of
repayment, date of original
loan and amount outstanding
against the loan(s) on the date
of the application and the
assets, if any, given as
security;
(e) a complete list of all other

loans, outstanding on the date
of application and the assets
given as security against
them;
(f) the purpose for which the loan
is proposed to be utilized and
the economics of the scheme.

Government institution on the strength of
a guarantee given by the trust managing
it, similar information should be called for
in respect of the trust also.
(iii)On receipt of the information called for
as mentioned in (ii) above, confidential
enquiries shall be made from the other
Departments of the Central Government
or State Governments from which the
party has taken loans, to judge the
performance in regard to the previous
loans. If the replies indicate that the
performance was not satisfactory, the
loan shall be refused. It must be analysed
that the financial position of the party is
sound. It shall also be ensured that the
security offered is adequate and its value



is at least thirty-three and one-third per
cent. above the amount of the loan. If
possible, an independent valuation of the
security offered shall be obtained. The
applicant for the loan must satisfy both
the criteria for financial soundness and
adequacy of security before a loan is
sanctioned.
(iv) In the case of Institutions which
receive Grants-in-aid from Government
to meet a part of their deficits and the
balance is met by the State Government
and the Trustees of Management, it shall
be ensured–

(a) that in computing the deficit

for purpose of the Grant-inaid, the income from the
scheme, if any, earmarked for
servicing the loan and the
instalment of repayment of
the loan and interest (if any) is
not included;
(b) that as far as possible, the

scheme for which the loan is
given is self-financing and
does not throw an additional
burden on the general income
of the institutions, e.g., in the
case of hostels for colleges
that the rents proposed are
adequate;
(c) the Institution produces an
undertaking from the State
Government or the
Management that any
shortfall towards repayment
of the loan and interest shall
be made good by it. In the
latter case the financial
position of the Management
(Trust) shall be investigated
after calling for information on
the lines of Rule 250. (3) (i)
above.
(v) Ministries or Departments of the
Central Government shall lay down a
procedure for periodical review of the old
loans so that prompt action can be taken,
if necessary, for enforcing regular
payments.
**Rule 250** **(4)** The detailed procedure to be followed
in connection with the Grant of loans to
local bodies shall be regulated by the
provisions of the Local Authorities Loans
Act and other special Acts and by rules
made thereunder.

Interest shall be charged at the rate
prescribed by the Government for any
particular loan or for the class of loans
concerned.
**Rule 251** **(2)** A loan shall bear interest for the day



76

repayment. Interest for any shorter period
than a complete year shall be calculated
as follows, unless any other method of
calculation is prescribed in any particular
case or class of cases.

**Corporations,** **Public** **Sector**
**Undertakings, etc.** Loans shall ordinarily
be sanctioned at the normal rates of
interest prescribed by Government for the
particular category of the loanee. In
cases where the normal rate is
considered too high and a concession is
justified, it shall take the form of direct
subsidy debitable to the grants of the
sanctioning authority. In such cases
interest shall, however, be paid by the
borrower in the first instance at the
normal rates and subsidy shall be
claimed separately.
**Rule 253** **(2)** **Agreements** **and** **other**
**documentation.**
(i) In the case of loans to parties other
than State Governments and
wholly owned Government
Companies, a loan agreement
specifying all the terms and
conditions shall be executed. A
clause shall invariably be inserted



in all such agreements enabling
Government at any time to call for
accounts of the applicant relating
to any accounting year with power
to depute an officer specially
authorized for this purpose to
inspect the applicant’s books, if
necessary.
(ii) A written undertaking in Form GFR
15 shall be obtained from a wholly
Government-owned company at
the time of sanctioning the loan.
The sanction shall specifically
state that such an undertaking
would be obtained from the loanee
before the drawal of the amount of
loan and a certificate that the
undertaking has been obtained,
shall be recorded by the Drawing
Officer of the office of the
sanctioning authority in the bill for
drawal of the amount of loan. The
sanction in respect of loans to
other organizations, where a
formal agreement is required to be
executed, shall also be issued in
the same manner.
**Rule 254** **Undertaking to be obtained from**
**wholly** **-** **owned** **Government**
**Companies.**
In the case of loans to wholly-owned
Government Companies, a written
undertaking to the effect that the fixed
assets of the company shall not be
hypothecated without prior approval of
the Government shall be obtained in
Form GFR 32. No stamp duty need be
paid on these written undertakings.
**Rule255** Loans to parties other than State
Governments, wholly owned Government
Companies and Local Administration of
Union Territories shall be sanctioned only
against adequate security. The security
to be taken shall ordinarily be at least
thirty- three and one-third per cent. more
than the amount of the loan. However, a
competent authority may accept security
of less value for adequate reasons to be
recorded.
**Rule 256** **(1)** **Submission** **of** **Utilization**
**Certificate, Reports, Statements, etc.**
In cases in which conditions are attached
to the utilization of loan, either in the
shape of the specification of the particular
objects on or the time within which the
money must be spent or otherwise, the
authority competent to sanction the loan
shall be primarily responsible for
certifying to the Accounts Officer where
necessary, the fulfillment of the
conditions attaching to the loan, unless
there is any special rule or order to the



77


contrary. The loans sanctioned to the
State Governments and the Local
Administration of Union Territories shall
not, however, come within the purview of
this rule.
**Rule 256** **(2)**
(i) The certificate referred to in Rule
256above shall be furnished as in
Form GFR 12-B and at such
intervals as maybe agreed to
between the Audit Officer and/or
the Accounts Officer, as the case
may be, and the Ministry or
Department concerned. Before
recording the certificate, the
certifying officer shall take steps
to satisfy himself that the
conditions, on which the loan was
sanctioned, have been or are
being fulfilled. For this purpose,
he may require the submission to
him at suitable intervals of such
reports, statements, etc., which
shall establish the utilization of
loan for the purpose for which it
was sanctioned. The loanee
institution may also be required
to furnish a certificate from its
Auditors that the conditions
attaching to the loan have been
or are being fulfilled. The
certificate shall give details of the
breaches, if any, of those
conditions.
(ii) A Certificate of Utilization of the
loan shall be furnished to the
Accounts Officer in every case of
loan made for specific purposes,
even if of the any conditions is not
specifically attached to the grant.
Such certificates are not,
however, necessary in cases
where loans are sanctioned not
for any specific purpose or object
but take the shape of a temporary
financial aid or where the loans
have been sanctioned to the
Public Sector Undertakings
intended for financing of their
approved capital outlays. The
repayment of loan, however, has
to be watched in the usual
manner.
(iii) In respect of loans the detailed
accounts of which are maintained
in the Audit Offices, the
authorities sanctioning the loan
shall furnish the Utilization
Certificate in respect of each
individual case.
(iv) Where the detailed accounts of
the loans are maintained bythe



Departmental authorities, a
consolidated Utilization
Certificate shall be furnished to
Audit by the
Ministries/Departments
sanctioning the loans to
Institutions / Organisations for
the total amount of the loans
disbursed during each year for
different purposes including the
loans sanctioned by their
subordinate officers. This
certificate shall not cover the
loans to individuals for which
Utilization Certificates need not
be furnished to the Accounts
Officer. The Certificate shall
indicate the year-wise and
object-wise break-up of loans
disbursed and the loans for which
Utilizations Certificates are
furnished. The utilization
certificate shall also show the
loans disbursed separately for
each sub-head of account to
facilitate verification by the
Accounts Officer.
(v) The Utilization Certificates shall
be furnished within a ‘reasonable
time’ after the loan is paid to the
institutions. The Department of
Central Government shall
prescribe, in consultation with the
Ministry of Finance, target dates
for the submission of the
Utilization Certificates by the
Department concerned to the
Accounts Officer. The target date
shall, as far as possible, be not
later than eighteen months from
the date of sanction of the loan.
(vi) In respect of loans, the detailed
accounts of which are maintained
by Departmental Officers and
where consolidated Utilization
Certificates are to be furnished to
Accounts Officer, the period of 18
months shall be reckoned from
the expiry of the financial year in
which the loans are disbursed.
The consolidated Utilization
Certificates in respect of such
loans paid each year shall,
therefore, be furnished not later
than September of the second
succeeding financial year.
(vii) The due dates for submission of
the Utilization Certificates shall
be specified in the letter of
sanction for loan. The target date
as specified shall be rigidly
enforced and extension shall only



78


be allowed in very exceptional
circumstances in consultation
with the Ministry of Finance
under intimation to the Audit
Officer and/or the Accounts
Officer, as the case may be. No
further loans shall be sanctioned
unless the sanctioning authorities
are satisfied about the proper
utilization of the earlier loan
sanctioned to an Institution, etc.
**Rule 257** **Installments of Loans.** When a loan of
public money is taken out in installments,
each installment of the loan so drawn
shall be treated as a separate loan for
purposes of repayment of principal and
payment of interest thereon except where
the various installments drawn during a
financial year are, for this purpose,
allowed to be consolidated into a single
loan as at the end of that particular
financial year. In the latter event, simple
interest at the prescribed rate on the
various loan installments from the date of
drawal of each installment to the date of
their consolidation shall be separately
payable by the borrower. Repayment of
each loan or the consolidated loan, as the
case may be, and the payment of interest
thereon shall be arranged by the
borrower annually on or before the
anniversary date of drawal or
consolidation of the loan in such number
of installments as the sanctioning
authority may prescribe. The sanctioning
authority may allow, in deserving cases a
moratorium towards repayment of
principal but not for the payment of
interest. Should it appear that there is an
undue delay on the part of the debtor in
taking out the last installment of a loan the
authority sanctioning the loan may at any
time declare that loan closed, and order
repayment of capital to begin. The
Accounts Officer shall bring to notice any
delay that appears to him to require this
remedy and he shall take this step
whether or not there are any dates fixed
for taking of installments.
**NOTE1.** These instructions are
applicable mutatis mutandis to loans, the
repayments of which are made by other
than annual installments.
**NOTE 2.** It must be remembered that the
calculation fixing the amount of equal
periodical installments, by which a loan is
repaid with interest, presupposes
punctual payment of the installment and
that, if any installment is not punctually
repaid, the interest amount shall need to
be recalculated.
**Rule 258** **(1) Defaults in Payment.** The loan



sanctions in favour of State or Union
Territory Governments and the loan
sanctions or undertakings or agreements
in case of wholly Government owned
companies or Public Sector Undertakings
shall invariably include provision for the
levy of penal interest on overdue
installments of interest or principal and
interest. The loan sanctions and
agreements in all other cases shall
invariably stipulate a higher rate of
interest and provide for lower rate of
interest in the case of punctual payments.
The penal or the higher rate of interest,
as the case may be, shall not, except
under special orders of Government, be
less than two and half per cent per annum
above the normal rate of interest
prescribed by Government from time to
time for the loans advanced.
**Rule 258** **(2)** Any default in the payment of interest
upon a loan or in the repayment of
principal, shall be promptly reported by
the Accounts Officer, to the authority
which sanctioned the loan. The
responsibility of the Accounts Officer,
under this rule refers only to the loans, the
detailed accounts for which are kept by
him.
**Rule 258** **(3)** Procedure to be followed in case of
defaults in repayment of interest free
loans or loans sanctioned at
concessional rates of interest:
(i) In the case of grant of interest
free loans e.g., loans to technical
educational institutions for
construction of hostels, prompt
repayment shall be made a
condition for the grant of interest
free loans. The sanction letter in
such cases shall provide that in
the event of any default in
repayment, interest at rates
prescribed by Government from
time to time will be chargeable on
the loans.
(ii) In the case of loans sanctioned at
concessional rates of interest the
difference between the normal
rate and concessional rate), shall
be made conditional upon prompt
repayments of principal and
payment of interest thereon by
the entity concerned.
(iii) In the cases where in addition to
interest free loans, subsidy is
also provided to meet running
expenses the sanction letter shall
provide that in the event of any
default in repayment, the
defaulted dues would be
recovered out of the subsidy



79


payable.

**Rule 258** **(4)** On receipt of a report of default
referred to in sub-rule (2) above, the
authority concerned shall immediately
take steps to get the default remedied
and also consider enforcement of penal
or higher rate of interest on the overdue
amounts. Where the sanctioning
authority is satisfied, having regard to the
circumstances of the case, that penal or
higher interest need not be recovered,
the borrower shall ordinarily be asked to
pay interest, at the normal rate prescribed
in the loan sanction, on the overdue
amount (of principal and/or interest) from
the due date of payment up to the date of
settlement of the default. The recovery of
additional interest shall not be waived
except in special circumstances or where
the period of defaults is very short, e.g., a
few days.
**Rule 259** **Irrecoverable** **Loans.** A competent
authority, after prior approval of the
Ministry of Finance may remit or write off
any loans owing to their irrecoverability or
otherwise.
**Rule 260** **Accounts and Control.** Subject to such
general or specific directions as may be
given by the Comptroller and AuditorGeneral in this behalf, detailed accounts
of loans to Institutions and Organizations,
etc., shall be maintained by the Accounts
Officer who shall watch their recovery
and see that the conditions attached to
each loan are fulfilled.
**Rule 261** The instructions contained in this Chapter
relating to cost of audit of Grants-in-aid
are applicable Mutatis mutandis in the
case of loans as well.
**Rule 262** **Annual Returns.**
Each Principal Accounts Officer shall
submit to the concerned Ministry or
Department of Government, a statement
in Form GFR 13 showing the details of
outstanding Central Loans borne on his
books as on thirty-first March each year.
This statement shall be submitted not
later than the following thirtieth
September and shall indicate the
aggregate of outstanding balance of
loans, details of defaults, if any, in
repayment of principal and/ or interest
and the earliest period to which the
default pertains, against each State or
Union Territory Government, foreign
Government, Railway or Department of
Posts funds, Central Public Sector and
other Government Institutions etc.
Where, however, detailed accounts are
not required to be maintained by the



Accounts Office, the statement shall
contain departmental authority-wise
aggregate balances of outstanding loans.
**Rule 263** **(1) Review of Annual Statements with**
**a view to enforce repayments of the**
**principal and interest due.**
The Administrative Ministries shall keep
watch over the receipt of the Annual
Statements in Form GFR 20 regularly
from the Accounts Officer and conduct a
close review of the cases of defaults in
repayment of the installments of principal
and/or interest due, as revealed from
these Annual Statements and take
suitable measures for enforcing
repayments of the principal and interest
due. If these statements are not received
in time, the Accounts Officer shall be
reminded promptly. To facilitate a proper
review of the position of outstanding
loans, the Ministries may also arrange to
maintain centrally a list of all sanctions
issued relating to loans advanced to
State Governments and other entities.
**Rule 263** **(2) Submission of Annual Assessment**
**Report.**
A copy of Annual Assessment Report on
status of all outstanding loans, including
timely and accurate payment of principal
and interest due, shall be submitted by
the Financial Advisor of the
Administrative Ministry concerned to the
Ministry of Finance by 30th June of each
financial year.

**Ch.-11 - GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES**

**Rule 275** **(1) Power to Give and Limits on**
**Government Guarantees.** The power of
the Union Government to give
guarantees emanates from and is subject
to such limits as may be fixed in terms of
Article 292 of the Constitution of India, the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget
Management Act and Rules framed there
under as amended from time to time.
**Rule 275** **(2)** In terms of the Fiscal Responsibility
and Budget Management Act and Rules
framed thereunder, the Central
Government shall not give guarantees
aggregating the amount prescribed
therein.
**Rule 275** **(3)** Powers to grant Government of India
Guarantee, including those on external
borrowings, vests with the Budget
Division, Department of Economic Affairs
(DEA).
**Rule 276** **Objectives** **of** **Government** (iii)
**Guarantees:** The sovereign guarantee is
normally extended for the purpose of
achieving the following objectives:
(i) To improve viability of projects or
activities undertaken by central
entities with significant social and
economic benefits;
(ii) To enable central public sector
companies to raise resources at
lower interest charges or on more
favourable terms;
(iii) To fulfill the requirement in cases
where sovereign guarantee is a
precondition for concessional
loans from bilateral/ multilateral
agencies to central public sector
companies/agencies.
**Rule 277** **Guidelines for grant of Government of**
**India** **Guarantee:** The following
guidelines should be followed by the
Ministries or Departments of the
Government of India for recommending
guarantee or counter guarantee.—
(i) A proposal for guarantee by
Government must be justified in
public interest such as in the
case of borrowings by central (iv)
public sector institutions for
approved development purposes
or borrowings by central public
sector undertakings from Banks
for working capital and other
purposes.
(ii) The Administrative Ministry/
Department or the credit
Divisions of Department of (v)
Economic Affairs shall examine
the proposal in consultation with
the Financial Adviser in the same



manner as a proposal for loan.
While examining the proposal the
following considerations shall be
kept in view:(a) Public interest which the

guarantee is expected to
serve.
(b) Credit worthiness of the

borrower to ensure that no
undue risk is involved.
(c) Terms of the borrowing shall

take into account the yields
as applicable on
Government paper of similar
maturity.
(d) The conditions prescribed in



the guarantee
order/agreement in order to
ensure continued credit
worthiness of the borrower.
(iii) Risk associated with assumption
of a new contingent
liability/guarantee proposal,
including the probability of future
payouts should be thoroughly
assessed by the concerned
Administrative
Ministry/Department or Credit
Divisions of Department of
Economic Affairs recommending
the proposal. Such assessment
should ideally be entrusted to an
independent unit and should be
undertaken even when it has
already been decided by a higher
authority to provide guarantees.
The assessment should reveal
an accurate picture of the
financial condition of the entity to
be guaranteed; risks associated
with implementation of the
project/ scheme, etc. This
information would be useful to
estimate the funds needed to
meet associated contingent
liabilities if the need should arise,
in current or future budgets.
(iv) After examination in the
concerned Ministry or
Department or Credit Division of
DEA, all proposals for extending
guarantees shall be referred to
Budget Division, DEA for
approval. No guarantees shall be
given without the approval of
Budget Division, DEA.
(v) With a view to enable the Ministry
of Finance to examine cases of
Government of India guarantees
and extension thereto, all



85


Ministries or Departments should
furnish to that Ministry, data of
certain operational parameters of
the Public Sector Undertaking or
Entity, as given in GFR26. In
case the accounts of the Central
Public Sector Undertaking or
Entity have been audited by the
Comptroller & Auditor General of
India, the effect of the comments
of the Comptroller & Auditor
General of India on the Central
Public Sector Undertaking’s
profitability should be brought
out. Further, where BIFR targets
have been assigned or Cabinet
directions issued to the
Company, the actuals vis-à-vis
targets for the preceding three
years should be indicated. The
data should be furnished in the
Form GFR 26 along with the
proposal for guarantee.
(vi) Guarantees shall normally be
restricted to the repayment of
principal and normal interest
component of the loan. Other
risks shall not form part of the
guarantee.
(vii) Government guarantees will be
extended to only central public
sector companies/ agencies.
(viii) Government guarantees shall not
be provided to the private sector.
(ix) Government guarantees should
normally not be extended for
external commercial borrowings.
(x) Government guarantees may be
given on all soft loan components
of the bilateral/ multilateral aid.
However, guarantee shall not be
normally given for the
commercial loan components of
such aid.
(xi) Government of India guarantee
will not be given in cases of
grants. However, if the donor
insists on ensuring performance,
the same may be listed as a
negotiating condition for getting
the grant.
(xii) Appropriate conditions, may be
made by Government while
giving the guarantee e.g. period
of guarantee, levy of fee to cover
risk, representation for
Government on the Board of
Management, Mortgage or lien
on the assets, submission to
Government of periodical reports
and accounts, right to get the
accounts audited on behalf of



Government etc. Even if fee,
representation and mortgage are
not considered necessary, the
right to verify the continued
credit–worthiness of the borrower
should be ensured.
(xiii) Guarantees may not be
proposed for pursuing low priority
objectives or programmes.
Proposal for grant of guarantee
as an off-budget support should
also be examined
comprehensively by the
proposing Ministry/Department
against other alternative forms of
support which may be more
appropriate and cost- effective.
For example, in the case of
provision of credit guarantees to
enterprises that continually incur
losses as a result of
government's pricing policy,
budgetary subsidies or direct
government loans may be a more
effective and less costly option.
(xiv) Guarantees may not be
proposed in respect of Central
Public Sector Enterprises whose
strong financial credentials and
high credit rating would indicate
inherent ability to directly raise
the required resources without
the support of government
guarantee.
**Rule 278** **Borrowings from multilateral agencies**
**by** **Central** **Public** **Sector**
**Undertakings.**
(i) All borrowings from the
multilateral agencies by Central
Public Sector Undertakings
would be direct (without
Government of India’s
intermediation) on the terms as
agreed mutually between the
borrower and the lender and
approved by the Government of
India. However, where such
terms involve guarantee of
Government of India, prior
approval of the Budget Division
of the Ministry of Finance may be
obtained.
(ii) The borrowing should relate to
the Projects approved by the
prescribed competent authority
of the Central Government.
(iii) Wherever guarantee is to be
given by Government of India,
the borrower shall enter into an
agreement with the Government
of India for the payment of
guarantee fee on the principal



86


amount of the loan drawn and
loan outstanding from time to
time.
(iv) The Government of India
Guarantee would only cover the
principal amount and the normal
interest. All other risks including
the exchange rate risk would be
shared between the borrower
and lender as per terms and
conditions prescribed in the loan
agreement.
**Rule 279** **(1) Levy of Guarantee Fees.** The rates
of fee on guarantees would be as notified
by the Budget Division, Department of
Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance
from time to time. The rates of guarantee
fee are given in Appendix - 12. Ministries
or Departments shall levy the prescribed
fee in respect of all cases. The fees are
also to be levied in respect of non-fund
based borrowings or credits (viz. letters of
credit, Bank guarantees etc.). In case of
any doubt with regard to the
categorisation of any particular
undertaking or organization or the nature
of borrowing for the purpose of levy of
fee, the matter may be referred to the
Budget Division for clarification. The
Ministries or Departments should also
take adequate steps to ensure prompt
recovery of the prescribed fees.
**Rule 279** **(2)** The guarantee fee should be levied
before the guarantee is given and
thereafter on first April every year. The
rate of guarantee fee is to be applied on
the amount outstanding at the beginning
of the guarantee year.
**Rule 279** **(3)** Where the guarantee fee is not paid
on the due date, fee should be charged at
double the normal rates for the period of
default.
**Rule 279** **(4)** The Government may guarantee no
more than 80% of the project loan,
depending on the conditions imposed by
the lender. This would incentivize the
lenders to make proper analysis of the
project, credit worthiness of the
borrower(s), and build strategies for risk
management. In such cases, bankers/
lenders may be asked to share the risk by
bearing a minimum of 20% of the net loss
associated with any default. The
arrangement would ensure that the
lenders undertake a more rigorous
assessment of the risk exposure.
Provided further that in certain
exceptional circumstances, the
Government of India may guarantee
100% of the financing where the
organisation concerned is discharging
some function on behalf of the



Government of India.
**Rule 280** **Execution of Government Guarantees.**
(i) Once the guarantee is approved
by Ministry of Finance, the
guarantees will be executed and
monitored by the Administrative
Ministries concerned, who are
also required to report the status
in this regard on an annual basis
till they are invoked or are
obliterated. The following
guidelines need to be kept in
view while issuing guarantees(a) The obligations of the
borrower to service the loan
and the guarantee, and the
monitoring of the utilization
of the guaranteed loans, and
adherence to the terms and
conditions of the guarantee
by the Borrower shall be
ensured by the
Administrative Ministry/
Department through a backto- back agreement with the
borrower which may be
drawn up and implemented
to the satisfaction of the
Administrative Ministry
concerned. For this
purpose, necessary records
to monitor the guarantee,
including servicing of
guarantee fee shall be
maintained by  the  Line
Ministries / Departments
concerned.
(b) Administrative Ministry
should ensure that there are
no inconsistencies between
the guarantee approval
given by the Ministry of
Finance and the guarantee
agreement signed by it with
the borrower. The
obligations enforced by the
Government as guarantor
would be duly factored in.
(c) Deviations / modifications /

amendments on the main
conditions of the guarantee,
particularly with reference to
the rate of interest on the
loan to be guaranteed and
obligations of the
Government to be covered,
should not be referred in a
routine manner to Budget
Division for clarification/
change. The Administrative
Ministry concerned shall
make out a separate case,



87


fully justifying the need for
considering any proposed
modifications /
amendments, after thorough
scrutiny of the request of the
borrower for the same,
before placing these
proposals before the Budget
Division for a final decision.
(d) In respect of bilateral and

multilateral credit, Standard
format of Guarantee of the
lending institutions may be
examined with a view that
the same are not in
contradiction with the
conditions of sovereign
guarantee prescribed in this
chapter, before signing by
the Administrative Ministry/
Department. The guarantee
agreement may also not
omit any conditions as
brought out in this Chapter.
New conditions or
covenants, and differences,
if any, shall be referred to
Budget Division of the
Department of Economic
Affairs (DEA) for
concurrence.
(e) Guarantee proposals
approved by the Budget
Division shall have to be
executed in the same
financial year. If the
guarantee/ loan agreement
is not signed in the same
financial year as that of the
approval of the guarantee
proposal, the guarantee
proposal shall have to be
submitted again.
(f) The guarantee shall hold
only for the specific purpose
agreed to by the Budget
Division.
(g) Guarantee given by
Government of India shall
be non - transferrable and
would cease to exist in case
the ownership of the entity is
transferred from
Government of India, unless
the Guarantee is reconfirmed by the Budget
Division.
(ii) The Financial Advisers in
Ministry/ Department will perform
the responsibility of maintenance
of records and reporting including
for the Finance Accounts and the



IGAS, through the office of
Controller/Chief Controller of
Accounts.
**Rule 281** **(1) Review of Guarantees.** All Ministries
or Departments shall ensure that all
guarantees are reviewed every year. The
monitoring or review undertaken should
examine whether the borrower is
discharging repayment obligations or
interest obligations as per terms of the
loan agreement, whether the repaying
capacity for the loan and guarantee
amount is imposed in any manner, and
whether all covenants and conditions are
being religiously followed. The Financial
Advisers of the Ministries or Departments
should undertake these reviews. A copy
of the review report including on timely
and correct payment of guarantee fees,
shall be forwarded by the Finance
Advisor to the Budget Division by 30th

recovery of guarantee fee;
(v) to send data as contained in
Form GFR 25, duly updated
every year to the Budget Division
in the Ministry of Finance,
Department of Economic Affairs
by tenth of April.
**Rule 281** **(3)** In respect of guarantees issued by the
Ministry of Finance for external loans, the
respective credit divisions of Department
of Economic Affairs shall conduct an
annual review in consultation with the
Financial Adviser (DEA). For this
purpose, the Financial Adviser (DEA)
shall ensure the maintenance of the
required registers, as well as ensure that
the annual reviews are carried out by the
concerned credit divisions, and report
forwarded to the Budget Division in Form
GFR 25. In cases, where the guarantees
on external loans are issued by the
concerned administrative Ministry, that
Ministry would be responsible for

caused by floods, cyclone, earthquake or
any other natural calamity or which is due
to an ordinary accident, which may occur
to any citizen, for example, loss by theft
or as a result of a railway accident or fire
etc. The mere fact that at the time of the
accident, the Government servant is
technically on duty or is living in
Government quarters in which he is
forced to reside for the performance of his
duties will not be considered as a
sufficient ground for the grant of
compensation.

Postal Life Insurance, Kolkata, about the issue
of a policy in favour of a subscriber authorizing
the Drawing Officer to commence recovery
from pay, or on receipt of a Last Pay
Certificate in respect of the subscriber
transferred from another office, the Drawing
Officer should make a note of the particulars
of the policy in the register. The name of the
office from which the subscriber has been
transferred should invariably be noted in the
remarks column. Wherever a subscriber is
transferred to another office or his policy is
discharged, his name should be scored out
from the register giving necessary remarks.
(iii) After the preparation of the monthly pay bill,

the amount of recovery on account of PLI
premium shown in the bill should be posted in
the monthly column in the register with proper
reference to the bills or the vouchers. The fact
of excess or non-recovery should be briefly
noted in the remarks column. Extracts should
be attached to the relevant bills in support of
the recoveries. While taking extracts it should
be seen that the names of those insurants
from whom recoveries were made in previous
months but no recoveries have been made
during the current month either on account of
transfer or discharge of that policy or on
account of leave salary being not drawn or the
official being on leave without pay, should be
included in the current month's schedule and
necessary remarks noted against their names.
(iv) Similarly, the remarks 'New Policy' or

Transferred from
……………………………Office should



93


begiven in the schedule against the names of
insurant entered for the first time in current
month. Reasons for short or excess recovery
should be noted briefly in the remarks column.
In short, schedule of Postal Life Insurance
recoveries to be attached to the bills, would be
a record not only of those from whom the
recovery has actually been affected but also
of those from whom recovery was being
affected previously but has not been affected.

#### **APPENDIX– 1**

[See Rule 37 ]


**INSTRUCTIONS FOR REGULATING THE ENFORCEMENT**

**OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES, ETC.**

**1.** The cardinal principle governing the assessment of responsibility is that, every Government officer should
exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure from public fund generally as a person of ordinary
prudence would exercise in respect of the expenditure and the custody of his own money. While, the competent
authority may, in special cases, condone an officer's honest errors of judgement involving financial loss if the
officer can show that he has acted in good faith and done his best up to the limits of his ability and experience,
personal liability shall be strictly enforced against all officers who are dishonest, careless or negligent in the
duties entrusted to them.
**2.** In cases where loss is due to delinquencies of subordinate officials and where it appears that this has been
facilitated by laxity of supervision on the part of a superior officer, the latter shall also be called strictly to
account and his personal liability in the matter carefully assessed.
**3.** **(a)** The question of enforcing pecuniary liability shall always be considered as well as the question of other
forms of disciplinary action. In deciding the degree of an officer's pecuniary liability, it will be necessary to look
not only to the circumstances of the case but also to the financial circumstances of the officer, since it should
be recognized that the penalty should not be such as to impair his future efficiency.
**(b)** In particular if the loss has occurred through fraud, every endeavour should be made to recover the whole
amount lost from the guilty persons and if laxity of supervision has facilitated the fraud, the supervising officer
at fault may properly be penalized either directly by requiring him to make good in money a sufficient proportion
of the loss or indirectly by reduction or stoppage of his increments of pay.
**(c)** It should always be considered whether the depreciated value of the Government property or equipment
lost, damaged or destroyed by the carelessness of individuals entrusted with their care should be recovered
from the delinquent official. The depreciated value of the stores may be calculated by applying the 20% of
depreciation in the case of vehicles, including cycles, and 15% in the case of calculating machines, on the
reduced balance every year. The amount to be recovered may be limited to the Government servant's capacity
to pay.
**4.** When a pensionable Government servant is concerned in any irregularity or loss, the authority investigating
the case shall bear in mind the provisions contained in Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules 1972 as
amended from time to time and immediately inform the Audit Officer and/or the Accounts Officer, as the case
may be, responsible for reporting on his title to Pension or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity, and the authority
competent to sanction Pension or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity and it will be the duty of the latter to make
a note of the information and see that the Gratuity or Death-Cum-Retirement Gratuity is not paid before a
conclusion is arrived at as regards the Government servant's culpability and final orders are issued thereon.
**5.** The fact that Government servants who were guilty of frauds or irregularities have been demobilized or have
retired and have thus escaped punishment, should not be made a justification for absolving those who are also
guilty but who still remain in service.
**6.** It is of the greatest importance to avoid delay in the investigation of any loss due to fraud, negligence, financial
irregularity, etc. Should the administrative authority require the assistance of the Audit Officer and/or the
Accounts Officer, as the case may be, in pursuing the investigation, he may call on that officer for all vouchers
and other documents that may be relevant to the investigation; and if the investigation is complex and he needs
the assistance of an expert Audit Officer/ Accounts Officer to unravel it, he should apply forthwith for that
assistance to Government which will then negotiate with Audit Officer and/or the Accounts Officer concerned
for the services of an investigating staff. Thereafter, the administrative authority and the Audit /Accounts
authority shall be personally responsible within their respective spheres, for the expeditious conduct of the
enquiry. In any case in which it appears that recourse to judicial proceedings is likely, the Special Police
Establishment or the State Police should be associated with the investigation.
**7.** Depending upon the results of the inquiry, departmental proceedings and/or prosecution shall be instituted at
the earliest moment against the delinquent officials concerned and conducted with strict adherence to the
Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1957, and other instructions prescribed in
this regard by Government.

[See Rule 52 ]


**PROCEDURE FOR PREPARATION OF**
**DETAILED ESTIMATES OF RECEIPTS**

**1.** **Revenue receipts. -** These comprise (i) Central taxes, duties and cesses administered by the Central Board
of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs; (ii) local taxes and duties and other receipts in
relation to the Union Territories without Legislature; (iii) interest receipts of loans and advances by the Central
Government as also interest charged to commercial departments, etc., (iv) notional receipts from adjustments
based on principles of accounting like grant assistance from foreign Governments or International institutions;
and (v) all other revenue receipts including dividends on equity investments of the Central Government, cesses
collected by the Ministries and Departments, etc.
**2.** **Capital Receipts.** These comprise (i) Internal debt (market loan, treasury bills, etc.); (ii) External debt; (iii)
Repayment of loans and advances made by the Central Government; (iv) Disinvestment Receipts (v) Other
Liabilities.
**3.** **(1)** Estimates of receipts of Central Taxes and Duties and External Aid receipts are prepared within the Ministry
of Finance by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Controller
of Aid Accounts and Audit. Estimates of internal debt (market loans) receipts are framed by the Budget Division.
**(2)** Estimates of revenue receipts of the Union Territory Administrations will be furnished to the Ministry of
Finance by the concerned Audit Officer / Accounts Officer wherever departmentalization of accounts has not
taken place and by the Controller of Accounts of the Union Territory Administrations where departmentalization
of accounts has been introduced.
**(3)** Estimates of receipts in all other cases will be prepared by Controller of Accounts of each Department after
obtaining necessary data by the 30th November from the various organizations / field units and such scrutiny
as may be necessary in the light of policy decisions and other post Budget developments.
**4.** Estimates will be furnished to the Ministry of Finance in prescribed forms (GFR 2, 2-A and 2-B) by the
prescribed date, each year for the ensuing Budget.
**5.** **(1)** In preparing the Revised Estimates, while previous year's actuals and current year's trends will be material
factors to review the original Budget Estimates, special attention should be devoted to making as realistic an
estimate as possible of receipts which are likely to materialize during the rest of the financial year.
**(2)** In framing the Budget Estimates for the ensuing year, the estimating authorities should exercise utmost
care. While all receipts which can be foreseen in the light of latest trends, decisions and developments must
be provided for, care should be taken to ensure that undue optimism does not influence these estimates.
Similarly, where the receipts have a seasonal character, due note should be taken thereof in preparing the
estimates.
**(3)** Receipts by way of recoveries from Central Government Ministries / Departments, are to be excluded in
preparing Receipt Estimates. Other recoveries (from the State and Union Territory Governments, foreign
Governments, companies and statutory bodies, individuals, etc.) will, however, be included in the Receipt
Estimates.
**(4)** Estimates of receipts by way of interest on loans and advances will be based on the terms of the loans
sanctioned, as entered in the Loan Registers, including defaults, if any. The estimates should be realistic; that
is to say, that the estimates should reflect not merely what is due but what is likely to be realized during the
year together with the reasons for non-recovery of the difference between receipts due and assumed in the
estimates. In the case of Public Sector Units, interest receipts expected from their internal resources should
be distinguished from notional recoveries offset by corresponding expenditure provisions in the form of
subsidies and loans.
Similarly, where repayments due are refinanced by further loans or by conversion of past loans into equity, the
details should be furnished.
**(5)** In reporting estimates of receipts by way of foreign grant assistance in cash or in kind, care should be taken
to classify foreign grant receipts in cash under the Major Head '1605 External Grant Assistance' and those in
the form of commodities under the Major Head '1606 Aid Materials and Equipment'. In the case of commodities
grants, identical provision will be made in expenditure estimates under the Major head '3606 Aid Materials and
Equipment's' (both as debits to represent the notional payment therefor and as credits - recoveries in reductions
of expenditure - to reflect the counter-balancing entries), as well as under the final functional Head of Account
showing the final destination and use of the aid materials and equipment. **(Refer to Form GFR 2A).**

**NOTE.** For utilization of cash grants, provision in expenditure estimates under the final functional Heads of
Account will be necessary.


93


**(6)** In reporting the estimates, the estimating authorities should confine their estimates to those items of receipts
which are to be accounted for finally in their own accounts and ultimately in the accounts of the Ministry/
Department to which they are subordinate. All other receipts/recoveries entering the accounts of another
Ministry/ Department should be communicated to the concerned Ministry/Department for consolidation in their
estimates (e.g., receipts of CGHS contributions and rent recoveries in respect of Government accommodation).


94


#### **APPENDIX– 3**

[ See Rule 52]


**INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF DETAILED**
**ESTIMATES OF EXPENDITURE FROM THE CONSOLIDATED FUND**

**1.** For purpose of Budget Estimates, expenditure from the Consolidated Fund –with the merger of Plan and NonPlan from Budget 2017-18 will comprise of expenditure on revenue account and on capital account including
loans and advances, and shown in the separate categories as applicable, comprising of I. Central Expenditure:
(i) Secretariat Expenditure; (ii) Central Sector Schemes and (iii) Other Central Expenditure and II. Transfers:
(i) Centrally Sponsored Schemes (ii) Finance Commission Transfers and (iii) Other Transfers.

**A.** **GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES**

**2.** To facilitate appropriate scrutiny and consolidation of Expenditure Estimates for reporting to the Ministry of
Finance, the Financial Adviser in each Ministry / Department will obtain detailed estimates and other supporting
data from each of the estimating authorities under the control of the Ministry / Department, in appropriate
forms, sufficiently in advance.
**3.** The framing of the Revised Estimates for the current year should always precede estimation for the ensuing
year. The Revised Estimates should be framed with great care to include only those items which are likely to
materialize for payment during the current year, in the light of (i) actuals so far recorded during the current
year, compared with the actuals for corresponding period of the last and previous years, (ii) seasonal character
or otherwise of the nature of expenditure, (iii) sanctions for expenditure and orders of appropriation or reappropriation already issued or contemplated and (iv) any other relevant factor, decision or development.
The Budget Estimate for the ensuing year should likewise be prepared on the basis of what is expected to be
paid, under proper sanction, during the ensuring year, including arrears of previous years, if any. Due attention
to considerations of economy must be paid and while all inescapable and foreseeable expenditures should be
provided for, care should be taken that the estimate is not influenced by undue optimism.
**4.** No lump sum provision will be made in the Budget except where urgent measures are to be provided for
meeting emergent situations or for meeting preliminary expenses on a project/scheme which has been
accepted in principle for being taken up in the financial year. In latter cases Budget provision will be limited to
the requirements of preliminary expenses and for such initial outlay, as, for example, on collection of material,
recruitment of skeleton staff, etc.
Provision for a 'token' demand should not be made in the Budget Estimates for the purpose of seeking approval
in principle for big schemes without the full financial implications being worked out and got approved by the
appropriate authorities. In accordance with instructions contained in Paragraph (viii) of Appendix (5), a 'token'
demand can be made during the course of a year for a project / scheme when the details thereof are ready
and funds are also available for undertaking it but it cannot be started without Parliament's approval, it being
in the nature of a 'New Service/New Instrument of Services'.
**5.** All estimates should be prepared on gross basis and 'voted' and 'charged' portions must be shown separately;
even expenditure met partly or fully from receipts taken in reduction of such expenditure or those
counterbalanced by receipts credited as revenue to the Consolidated Fund, must be reported in such estimates
on gross basis. Care should also be taken to ensure that all notional receipts reported in 'Receipt Estimates'
(such as interest receipts fully or partly subsidized, loan repayment receipts partly or fully refinanced through
further loans or conversions into equity, receipts of foreign grant assistance in the form of commodities or
material, etc.) are properly matched by adequate provisions in expenditure estimates.
**6.** The estimates of expenditure should include all items which are fully accounted for in the accounts of the
Ministry/Departments to which the estimating authority is subordinate; they shall also cover expenditure, if any,
in Union Territories without Legislature, whether provided for in the demands of the said Ministry / Department
or in the 'Area' demand of the concerned Union Territory. Estimates of 'Works Expenditure', if any, against the
provisions in the demands of the Ministry of Urban Development, as well as expenditure on pensions (including
commutation payments, gratuity payments, pension contributions, etc.) interest payments, loans and
advancesto Government servants, etc., which are provided for in the centralized Grants/Appropriations
controlled by the Ministry of Finance should be furnished to the Ministry of Urban Development and the Ministry
of Finance.
**7.** The estimate of establishment charges should be framed taking into account the trends over preceding three
years and other relevant factors like changes in rates of pay, allowances, number of posts and their filling and
the economy instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time.


95


**8.** Expenditure estimates will be prepared with full accounts classification, i.e., Major/Sub-Major Head, Minor
Head, Sub-Head, Detailed Head and Object Head of Account. The correctness of accounts classification must
be ensured by the Principal Chief Controller / Chief Controller/ Controller of Accounts in each case. Doubts, if
any, may be clarified beforehand in consultation with the Ministry of Finance, Budget Division and Controller
General of Accounts. The relevant Grant number and title of Appropriation should also be mentioned to
facilitate identification of the provision in Budget Estimates for the current year.
**9.** Unless otherwise indicated by the Ministry of Finance, estimates (both Revised Estimates for the current year
and Budget Estimates for the ensuing year) should reach the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic
Affairs, Budget Division, by the date prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, each year, in triplicate in Form GFR
4, a separate form being used for each Major Head of Account.
**10.** To facilitate appreciation and scrutiny of the estimates, any major variations between the Budget and Revised

Estimates for the current year and also between the Revised Estimates for the current year and Budget
Estimates for the ensuing year should be explained cogently. In particular, all provisions for subsidy, capital
investment or loan to a Public Sector Undertaking, must be explained by indicating their purpose and the
extent to which they are intended to cover losses, working capital needs, debt or interest liabilities of the
undertaking.
**11.** Wherever the proposed estimates attract the limitations of 'New Service/New Instrument of Service', the fact

must be specifically highlighted. The guidelines to be followed in this regard are indicated in Annexure - I to
this Appendix. For all 'new' schemes, other than purely 'works' projects, the estimates proposed should be
supported by details set out in Annexure - II to this Appendix. In the case of provisions of 'Grants-in-aid' to
non- Government entities, the full purpose thereof and the nature of the grants, whether recurring or nonrecurring, should also be indicated.
**12.** All provisions for transfer of Government assets to Public Sector Undertaking and other non-Government

entities must also be highlighted, indicating whether the transfer is by way of grants or by way of equity
investment or loan. Similarly, in the case of nationalization or take-over of any private sector assets, the related
provisions in estimates must be supported by full details, such as the effective date of take-over, the agreed
compensation amount and the manner of its payment, etc. In cases of takeover, where the assets are
simultaneously transferred to a Public Sector Undertaking, it must be ensured that the estimates provide for
(i) payment of compensation for the take-over, (ii) for transfer of assets to the Public Sector Undertaking, by
means of recovery of compensation payment to be taken in reduction of expenditure, and (iii) provisions for
equity or loan to the Public Sector Undertaking.

**B.** **SCHEME RELATED EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES**

**13.** The Budget Division through the yearly Budget Circular will prescribe the form and the manner in which

proposals are required to be submitted to them for determining the scheme allocations,(both Central Sector
Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes) for the ensuing year. The Financial Adviser in each Ministry /
Department of the Central Government will accordingly call for requisite data from the estimating authorities,
public sector and other enterprises under the control of the Ministry / Department, etc. The approved
allocations for Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes will be communicated by the Ministry of
Finance to the Central Ministries / Department. Ministries/ Departments will finalize the Statement of Budget
Estimates, indicating the total outlay approved for each scheme / organization and the extent to which it is to
be met from extra-budget resources and from provisions in the Demands for Grants.
**14.** Subject to such directions as may be issued by the Ministry of Finance from time to time, the Revised Estimates

for the current year and Budget Estimates of the ensuing year, in respect of Scheme provisions, are to be sent
to the Ministry of Finance in Form GFR 7. For furnishing these estimates, instructions for preparation and
submission of Other than scheme Expenditure Estimates will apply to the extent relevant; in addition, the
following points should also be borne in mind :**(i)** Such part of the approved budgetary support for Scheme outlay as relates to 'works expenditure' and has
been accepted by the Ministry of Urban Development for inclusion in their Demands for Grants should be
excluded by the other Ministries / Departments in reporting the estimates to the Ministry of Finance in
Form GFR 4.
**(ii)** In the case of, provisions for equity investments and loans to public sector and other enterprises, as well

as those for grants-in-aid, specific schemes, for which the outlay is provided and the extent for each of
them is also to be indicated clearly.
**(iii)** Provisions for Scheme expenditure on Central Sector Schemes and Centrally Sponsored Schemes,

including such expenditures in Union Territories, are to be included in the relevant demand of the
Administrative Ministry/ Department and not in 'Area' Demand of the concerned Union Territory.

[See Note below Rule 52]


**PROCEDURE FOR COMPILATION OF**

**DETAILED DEMANDS FOR GRANTS**

**1.** The Demand for Grants are presented to Parliament at two levels. The Main Demands for Grants are presented
to Parliament by the Ministry of Finance along with the Annual Financial Statement while the Detailed Demands
for Grants are laid on the Table of the Lok Sabha by the concerned Ministries a few days in advance of the
discussion of the respective Ministries Demands in that House.
Both the Main Demands for Grants as also the Detailed Demands for Grants comprise three parts each, viz.Part - I shows the Service for which the Demand (or Appropriation) is intended and the estimates of the gross
amount, separately for Voted and Charged Expenditure, under Revenue and Capital (including Loan) sections
required in the ensuing year in respect of that Service.
Part - II shows break up of the estimates separately. In the Main Demands for Grants, the break up is exhibited
up to the level of Major Heads of Account which correspond to functions of the Government.
In the Detailed Demands for Grants the break up in respect of activities/schemes/organization up to the object
head level is given.
The Detailed Demands for Grants also exhibit actuals of the previous year in Part - II.
Both in the Main Demands for Grants as well as in the Detailed Demands for Grants, the details of recoveries
taken in reduction of expenditure provided for in the Demand or Appropriation are also depicted.
**2.** All Detailed Demands for Grants of a Ministry / Department are consolidated in a single volume and presented
to Lok Sabha by the concerned Ministry / Department. The Detailed Demands show ‘actual expenditure’ as
per accounts in the previous year, Budget and Revised Estimates for the current years and Budget Estimates
for the ensuing year.
**(i)** The process of compilation should start in July / August with the preparation of a manuscript skeleton.

Manuscript skeletons of Detailed Demands for the ensuing year should be prepared by using the printed

Detailed Demands for the current year by making necessary alterations therein. New sub-heads
sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance, if any, and those expected to be required should also be added in
the manuscript at appropriate places. The manuscript should then be sent to the designated press for a
proof. Where necessary, a second proof may be obtained. The printed skeletons should be available with
the Ministries/ Departments preferably by the 15th October each year.
**(ii)** Two copies of the Demand skeleton may then be sent to the Principal Accounts Officer, as the case may

be, for filling the ‘Actuals’ column for the previous year and to return one copy duly filled in.
**(iii)** In the master copy of the Demand, the Ministry / Department will then post (1) the figures of actuals as

reported by the Principal Accounts Officer / Accountant-General; (2) Revised Estimates for the current
year and the Budget Estimates for the ensuing year from the office copy of the SBEs /Demands for Grants
sent to Ministry of Finance. While posting these entries, care should be taken to ensure that –
**(a)** “Charged” items are shown in italics and are not mixed up with “Voted” provisions;

**(b)** posting is done accurately against the proper item / head of account including “recoveries”, if any,
taken as reduction of expenditure;
**(c)** new items are inserted at the proper place under the relevant minor head;

**(d)** totals of sub-heads, minor heads, major heads, etc., are correctly worked out and posted; that totals
of Revenue section and Capital section as well as the grand totals are correct and show “Charged”
and “Voted” figures distinctly; and
**(e)** new sub-head (opened through Supplementary Demands) or otherwise or any change in the
numbering and nomenclature sanctioned by the Budget Division since the proof of the skeleton
should also be incorporated in the Master Copy.
NOTE :–A sub-head should appear in the Demand only when there is provision thereunder, either in the
current year(Budget or Revised) or the ensuing year. Wherever only actuals of the previous year pertaining
to a sub-head are to be exhibited, this should be done by inserting suitable footnote on the relevant page.
**(iv)** The process of compilation and printing of the Demands should be undertaken in stages.
**3.** The first proof of individual Demands may be obtained after posting actuals of previous year and other than

Scheme estimates (by 15th December). The second proof may be similarly obtained (by 15th January) after
”Scheme” Revised estimates are posted in the first proof. As soon as “Scheme” provisions for the ensuing year
are finalized and communicated by the Ministry of Finance, they should be posted in the second proof. Before
obtaining the third proof, the following material may also be added.


99


**(A) Main Demands for Grants :**

**(i)** Notes on the Demands for Grants highlighting the following :**(a)** The objectives of the concerned Ministry / Department, how the programmes undertaken or
contemplated contribute towards attainment of such objectives and the agencies entrusted with the
execution of such programmes;
**(b)** Details of important provisions included in Demands for Grants with particular emphasis on Scheme
provisions and new items of expenditure;
**(c)** Cogent reasons for significant variations between the Budget Estimates and Revised Estimates for
the current year and between the Revised Estimates, for the current year and the Budget Estimates

**(d)** Provisions for subsidy in lieu of interest on loans by the Government or token provisions for
concessional rate of interest along with number of likely cases involved and financial implications,
if determinable; and
**(e)** Complete details of the estimated cost of a project together with its economics and financial
implications (whenever these estimates are revised and the cost of escalation exceeds 20 per cent
of the sanctioned cost or Rs. 3 crores, whichever is more, full reasons therefor and the effect thereof
on the economics of the projects should also be included in the Notes on Demands).
**(ii)** A statement giving details of provisions in the Budget which attract limitations of “New Service”/”New

Instrument of Service”.
**(B) Detailed Demands for Grants :**

The Detailed Demands for Grants will be accompanied by the following schedules/ statements:**(i)** Schedule showing the estimated strength of establishment and provision therefor.
**(ii)** Statement showing project-wise provision for expenditure on externally aided projects in the Central

and Schemes”, e.g., where the Ministry / Department do not bring out performance Budgets.
**5.** The third proof on receipt from the press should be thoroughly checked for accuracy of all estimates and other
data, as these must necessarily conform with the main Demands for Grants. Therefore, for obtaining page
proof, all pages should be serially numbered and table of contents prepared. The page proof received from the
Press should be fully scrutinized.
**6.** A sample printed copy of the Demands should be scrutinized on receipt from Press and where necessary an
errata may be prepared, got printed and pasted by the Press in individual copies of the Printed Demands.
**7.** The Demands of smaller Departments like Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, Department of Parliamentary Affairs,
Staff, Household and Allowances of the President, Secretariat of the Vice-President and Union Public Service
Commission which are clubbed in a single volume are to be prepared and presented by the Ministry of Finance.

#### **APPENDIX – 5**

[Rule 66]


**PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED IN CONNECTION**
**WITH THE DEMANDS FOR SUPPLEMENTARY GRANTS**

An excess over the sanctioned Grant or Appropriation may arise owing to either –
**(a)** an unforeseen emergency; or
**(b)** under-estimated or insufficient allowance for factors leading to the growth of expenditure. In the case of an

excess of either type the Head of the Department or the Controlling Officer concerned should proceed as
follows :**(i)** He should, in the first place, examine the allotments given to other Disbursing Officers under the same

detailed head within the unit of appropriation, and transfer to the Disbursing Officer who requires an
additional allotment such sum as can be permanently or temporarily spared. Since appropriation audit is
ordinarily conducted against total allotments for a unit, re-appropriation in the technical sense of the word
is not involved in such cases. The process amounts only to redistribution which the Controlling Officer can
ordinarily effect without reference to any other authority.
**(ii)** Should he find such redistribution impossible he should examine the allotments against other detailed

heads inside the primary units of appropriation, with the object of discovering probable savings and effecting
a transfer. Where such redistribution is feasible, he should if he has been vested with the necessary powers,
carry it out. Otherwise, he should obtain the sanction of the competent authority.
**(iii)** If the provision of funds from within the primary units proves to be impossible, an examination of the whole

grant should be undertaken to see whether there are likely to be savings under any of the other units of
grant or appropriation which can be utilized to meet it. If so, he should proceed as indicated in Clause (ii)
above.
**(iv)** If such savings are not available, it should be seen whether special economies can be effected under other

primary units of appropriation. If funds cannot be provided by either of these methods, it will have to be
considered whether the excess should be met by postponement of expenditure or whether an application
for supplementary grant or appropriation should be made.
**(v)** The Supplementary Demand for Grants shall be presented to the Parliament in a number of batches as

decided by the Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs. The first batch shall normally consist
of requirements of the following nature :**(a)** Cases where advances from Contingency Fund of India have been granted, which are required to
be recouped to the Fund.
**(b)** Payment against a court decree, which cannot be postponed; and
**(c)** Cases of additional requirement of funds for making immediate payments, which can be met by reappropriation of savings in the Grant but attract the limitation of New Service / New Instrument of
Service.
**(vi)** All applications for supplementary grants or appropriations should be submitted by the Department of the

Central Government administratively concerned to the Ministry of Finance on such dates and in such forms
/ batches as may be prescribed by the latter from time to time.
**(vii)** On receipt of an application for a supplementary grant, the Ministry of Finance will review the position of

the grant of appropriation as a whole with reference to the known actuals of the year to date and the actuals
and estimates for previous years. If after this examination, the Ministry of Finance comes to the conclusion
that it should be possible for the Administrative Department to meet the expenditure from within the
sanctioned grant either from normal savings or by special economies or in the last resort by judicious
postponement of other expenditure or in the last resort by judicious postponement of other expenditure, the
Administrative Department will be so informed and no supplementary demand will be presented to
Parliament. If, on the other hand, the Ministry of Finance considers that a supplementary grant will be
necessary, a demand will be placed before Parliament.
**(viii)** If during the course of the year it is found necessary to incur expenditure on a ‘New Service’ not provided for

in the annual budget the Administrative Department shall explain to the Ministry of Finance why the expenditure
was not provided for in the original budget and why it cannot be postponed for consideration in connection with
the next budget. The Ministry of Finance, if satisfied on these points, will consider whether it would not be
reasonable to ask the department concerned to curtail its other expenditure so as to keep the total within the
grant. Ordinarily, no “new service” or item will be accepted by the Ministry of Finance, unless the department
concerned can guarantee that the extra expenditure will be met from normal savings or by special economies
within the grant. Cases which involve additional grant will normally be accepted by the Ministry of Finance only


101


if they relate to matters of real imperative necessity or to the earning or safeguarding of revenue. The demand
for a supplementary grant of appropriation or a token vote in respect of a “new service” will be presented to
Parliament as soon as practicable after the need arises.

**NOTE.** –The expression ‘New Service’ wherever used in this Appendix includes – ‘New Instrument of Service’.

**TRANSFER OF LAND AND BUILDINGS BETWEEN**

**THE UNION AND STATE GOVERNMENTS**

**1.** These rules apply to the transfer of land and buildings between the Union and the State Governments and
also to the surrender to the State Governments of land belonging to Railways.
The general position under Article 294 of the Constitution is that as from the commencement of the Constitution

    (a) all property and assets which immediately before such commencement were vested in His Majesty for the
purposes of the Government of the Dominion of India and all property and assets which immediately before
such commencement were vested in His Majesty for the purpose of the Government of each Governor’s
Province, shall vest respectively in the Union and the corresponding State; and all rights, liabilities and
obligations of the Government of the Dominion of India and of the Government of each Governor’s Province,
whether arising out of any contract or otherwise, shall be the rights, liabilities and obligations respectively of
the Government of India and the Government of each corresponding State subject to any adjustment made or
to be made by reason of the creation before the commencement of the construction of the Dominion of
Pakistan or of the Province, of West Bengal, West Punjab and East Punjab.
Article 294, as is evident, relates to succession to property, assets, rights, liabilities and obligations in certain
cases only; Article 295 of the Constitution which relate to succession to property, assets, rights, liabilities and
obligations in other cases, provides that **(i)** As from the commencement of the Constitution:

**(a)** all property and assets which immediately before such commencement were vested in any Indian

State corresponding to a State specified in Part -B of the First Schedule shall vest in the Union if
specified in Part - B of the First Schedule shall vest in the Union if the purpose for which such property
and assets were held immediately before such commencement will thereafter be purposes of the
Union relating to any of the matters enumerated in the Union List; and
**(b)** all rights, liabilities and obligations of the Government of any Indian State corresponding to a State

specified in Part -B of the First Schedule, whether arising out of any contract or otherwise, shall be the
rights, liabilities and obligations of the Union Government, if the purposes for which such rights were
acquired or liabilities or obligations were incurred before such commencement will thereafter be
purposes of the Union Government relating to any of the matters enumerated in the Union List:
subject to any agreement entered into in that behalf by the Union Government with the Government
of that State.
**(ii)** Subject as aforesaid, the Government of each State specified in Part ‘B’ of the First Schedule shall, as from

the commencement of the Constitution, be the successor of the Government of the corresponding Indian
State as regards all property and assets and all rights, liabilities and obligations, whether arising out of any
contract or otherwise, other than those referred to in Clause (1).
All property and assets, which include land and buildings, and which vest in the State Government under
Articles 294 and 295 of the Constitution or otherwise shall be at the disposal of the respective State
Governments, who will be at liberty to dispose them of by sale, mortgage, etc., and the proceeds thereof
shall be credited to the revenues of the respective State Governments.
From the commencement of the Constitution, the transfer of land between the Union and the State
Government shall be regulated by mutual agreement except when they are acquired under some Act. The
Union Government have laid down the following principles to be observed in regard to certain points :**(i)(a)** When land belonging to a private party has to be acquired on behalf of the Union Government
acquisition shall be at the expense of that Government.
**(b)** In cases where the Union Government require any land, which is in occupation of the State
Government, to be transferred to them, the amount payable by the Union Government will ordinarily
be the market value of the land and buildings, if any, thereon.
**(c)** The amount payable will include the capitalized value of land revenue assessable on the land when
the transfer causes actual loss of land revenue to the State Government.
**(d)** Solatium of 15 per cent payable under the Land Acquisition Act will not apply to such transfers.
**(ii)** _Land surplus to the requirements of the Union Government_ :- When the Union Government no longer
required land in their possession, the Government of the State in which it is situated will be given the option
of assuming possession of the whole or any portion thereof subject to the following conditions:**(a)** the Union government themselves shall be the judges of whether they require to retain any particular

land or not;


108

they shall be entitled to do so only if the value of the land as a whole is not materially reduced by the
division; and
**(e)** if the State Government do not desire to assume possession of any land on the foregoing terms, the

Union Government will be free to dispose it of to a third party. Before, however, so disposing of the
land, the Union Government will consult the State Government as to the levy of ground rent or
assessment and the conditions, if any, subject to which it should be sold and they will, as far as
possible, dispose of the land subject to the conditions which the State Government may desire to
impose. The Union Government are not, however, bound to obtain the concurrence of the State
Government in all cases, and in cases of disagreement the Union Government shall be the sole judge
of the terms and conditions to be imposed.
**(i)** _Determination of Disputes as to Titles_ . - Disputes as to title between the Union Government and a State
Government shall be determined by the Supreme Court.
**2.** _Market value defined_ . -Market value when applied to land may be defined as the price which the land would
fetch if sold in the open market subject to the ground rent or assessment shown against it in the revenue
registers, or, if no ground rent or assessment shown against it in the revenue registers, subject to a ground
rent or assessment levied at the rate at which ground rent or assessment is actually being levied on similar
lands in the neighbourhood excluding all cases in which such similar lands in the neighbourhood are held
free of ground rent or assessment at favourable or unfavourable rates of ground or assessment. This is the
market value which has to be credited or debited, as the case may be, in the case of all transactions
between the State Governments and the Union Government or between the Union Government and State
Governments or the Railways.

documents of title relating to the property or of the securities mentioned in the order, and request them to
forward the Title Deeds, or securities in a registered cover and to insure the cover for Rs. 100. These do not
require to be endorsed, as the vesting order operates to transfer the securities to the Treasurer.

**II. MISCELLANEOUS TRUST ACCOUNTS**

5. If, under any general or special orders of Government, an Audit Officer / Accounts Officer or any other
Government officer is required to act in his official capacity as a Trustee or Depository of any public or quasipublic fund, which does come within the scope of the accounts of Government, or of any Charitable
Endowment and is not a Government security held in trust under the rules in Chapter IX of the Government
Securities Manual, such an officer should endeavour to have the trust vested, if possible, in the Treasurer of
Charitable Endowments for India; but, if that course is not possible, he should open an account with the State
Bank of India, or with any other approved Bank, for the deposit of moneys received by him on account of Trust.
Full and clear record of all transactions relating to the trust fund should be kept in the books of accounts in his
personal custody in a form complying with the terms and conditions of the Trust. The securities, if any,
deposited with him should be dealt with in accordance with the instructions contained in Chapter IX of the
Government Securities Manual.
6. The books of accounts should be supported by a short statement descriptive of the nature and obligation of
the Trust, with reference to the documents bearing upon it, so that any other Government officer on receiving
charge may know by reference to it exactly what his obligations are in the matter.
**NOTE.**   - _The receipt and disposal of interest should be recorded in these accounts which are meant for the_
_principal of the Trusts only._
7. The accounts should be balanced and closed every 31st day of March. They should also be balanced and
closed when the Government officer acting as the Trustee makes over charge of his office to a successor or
substitute, a balance sheet being appended to the charge report and signed both by the officer receiving and
the officer giving over charge.
8. The accounts will be subject to such audit check as may be prescribed by Government.

from the ascertained wishes or presumable intentions of the founder of an endowment, there shall ordinarily,
and unless the Central Government otherwise directs, be precious publication of the proposed vesting order or
scheme or modification.
**4. Mode of previous publication.**

(1) Unless the Central Government is of opinion that a proposed vesting order or proposed scheme or

modification of a scheme may be made or settled without previous publication, it shall publish a draft of the

to be affected thereby.
(2) The publication shall be made in the Official Gazette and in such other manner as the Central Government

**5. Costs.** The cost of the previous publication under Rule 4 of any proposed order, scheme or modification of a

scheme, and any other costs incurred or which may be incurred in the making of the orders or in the settlement

**10. Registers of securities.** - On the receipt of any securities for money, or on their purchase by himself, the

Treasurer shall record their receipt in a register in Form 1. He shall also keep a separate account for each
endowment in Form 2, in which he shall record all receipts including any amount sent for investment, and all
disbursements. In the cash account in Part - II of Form 2 the Treasurer shall record only his own transactions
(such as the payment of the money to the administrator), and not the transactions of the administrators of the

ledger of interest received shall be taken out and agreed annually with the total amount of the interest drawn.

prove the balance actually held by the Treasurer in his own hands, a balance sheet in Form 4 shall be made
out actually and agreed with the actual securities in the Treasurer’s possession. Such agreement shall be
certified on the balance sheet.
**15. Publication of accounts.** -A list of all properties vested in the Treasurer and an abstract of the accounts of the

interest and the annual agreement of balance shall be published in the Official Gazette on the 15th June of
each year.

securities and will also contain the abstract of accounts required by the Act to be published. The Treasurer

months from the date of publication of accounts in the Official Gazette.

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. The retention period specified in Column (4), in the case of a file, is to be reckoned form the year in which the
file is closed (i.e., action thereon has been completed) and not necessarily from the year in which it is recorded.
2. In the case of records other than files, e.g., registers, the prescribed retention period will be counted from the
year in which it has ceased to be current.
3. In exceptional cases, a record may be retained for a period longer than that specified in the schedule, if it has
certain special features or such a course is warranted by the peculiar needs of the department. In no case,
however, will a record be retained for a period shorter than that prescribed in the schedule.
4. If a record is required in connection with the disposal of another record, the former will not be weeded out until
after all the issues raised in the latter have been finally decided, even though the retention period marked on
the former may have expired in the meantime. In fact, the retention periods initially marked on such records
should be consciously reviewed and, where necessary, revised suitably.

**NOTES.-**
(1) Before any pay bills/pay registers are destroyed, the service of the Government servants concerned should

be verified under Rule257in accordance(1) with .
(2) The periods of preservation of account records in Public Works Offices are prescribed separately by

Government.
(3) Where a minimum period after which any record may be destroyed has been prescribed, the Head of a

Department or any other authority empowered by him to do so, may order in writing the destruction of such
record in their own and subordinate offices on the expiry of that period counting from the last day of the latest
financial year covered by the record.
(4) Heads of Departments shall be competent to sanction the destruction of such other records in their own and

subordinate offices as may be considered useless, but a list of such records as property appertain to the
accounts audited by the Indian Audit and Accounts Departments shall be forwarded to the Audit Officer and
or the Accounts Officers, as the case may be, for his concurrence in their destruction before the destruction is
ordered by the Head of Department.
(5) Full details shall be maintained permanently, in each office, of all records destroyed from time to time.

**Note** - The principle to be adopted in respect of files having financial implications and hence liable to be called by
audit for inspection is that such files should be retained for a period of five years after they have been recorded. If,
at any time during the period of five years, an audit objection having reference to the transaction dealt with in that
file arises, is received, the file will not be destroyed until after the audit objection has been settled to the satisfaction
of the audit. Also, if local audit does not take place within the period of five years, the Head of the Office should
ascertain from the audit authorities whether they have any objection to the files relating to the earlier years, due for
weeding out by the application of the five year formula, being destroyed or retained for a further period for scrutiny
by the audit party and, if so, for what period.
While records may be reviewed and weeded out at periodical intervals in the light of the retention periods prescribed
to avoid their build-up, the attempt should be to make a continuous and conscious effort throughout the year to
weed out unnecessary records. In other words, the working rules should be “weed as you go”.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. The retention period specified in Column (4) in the case of a file, is to be reckoned from the year in which
the file is closed (i.e., action thereon has been completed) and not necessarily from the year in which it is
recorded.
2. In the case of records other than files, e.g., registers, the prescribed retention period will be counted from
the year in which it has ceased to be current.
3. In exceptional cases, a record may be retained for a period longer than that specified in the Schedule, if it
has certain special features or such a course is warranted by the peculiar needs of the Department. In no
case, however, will a record be retained for a period shorter than that prescribed in the schedule.
4. If a record is required in connection with the disposal of another record, the former will not be weeded out
until after all the issues raised on the latter have been finally decided, even though the retention period
marked on the former may have expired in the meantime. In fact, the retention periods initially marked on
such records should be consciously “reviewed and where necessary revised suitably”.

#### **APPENDIX - 10**

[See Rule 61 and Rule 69]


**“CHECK AGAINST PROVISION OF FUNDS”**

The pre-check to be applied to all payments by the departmentalized Accounts Officers includes a check against
provision of funds also. It is an important part of the functions of the Accounts Office to see that no payment is made
in excess of the budget allotment. In order to exercise an effective check in this behalf, a separate register (DDOwise Bill Passing-cum-Expenditure Control Register –Form CAM –9) should be maintained in the Accounts Officer
for each Drawing Officer and by sub-heads and units of appropriation so as to ensure at the time of passing each
bill that the amount of the bill under check is covered by Budget allotment. If the amount of any bill leads to excess
over the Budget allotment or is not covered by an advance from the Contingency Fund, the Accounts Officer should
decline payment under advice to the authority controlling the grant so that the latter could arrange for additional
funds. An Appropriation Audit Register (Form CAM – 62) shall be maintained.

**NOTE.** - In cases where payment of a bill/claim would lead to excess over the provision under any unit of
appropriation the payment may be made by the Pay and Accounts Office only on receipt of an assurance in writing
from the Ministry/Head of Department controlling the grant that the expenditure involved is not on a New Service,
or New Instrument of Service; that necessary funds to accommodate the expenditure will be provided for in time by
issue of re- appropriation order, etc., that a note to the effect has been kept for further action, and that the grant as
a whole (i.e., separately under Revenue and Capital Sections) is not likely to be exceeded. This applies in respect
of any new item of expenditure, provision for which does not exist in the Budget (as distinct from expenditure on
“New Service” or “New Instrument Service” not provided in the Budget) as well as in cases where the existing
provisions is not sufficient to cover the payments. **In case of an urgent requirement of expenditure attracting**
**the provisions of New Service/New Instruments of Service and thereby supplementary demands through**
**theapproval of Parliament, the same should be referred to Ministry of Finance. The excess expenditure in**
**such cases can be allowed by the concerned Financial Advisers only on the specific approval of Secretary**
**(Expenditure) that the necessary funds will be made available through the next batch of supplementary**
**demands for grant.**
If such a contingency in regard to inevitable payment of a bill should arise towards the close of financial year and
the grant as a whole is likely to get exceeded thereby, order of the FA on behalf of the Chief Accounting Authority
would have to be sought.
In case the additional funds required are to be made available merely by reallocation (and not by re- appropriation)
of savings, if any, under the same sub-head of appropriation, the related claim will be passed for payment only after
additional funds therefor are allocated in writing by the Controlling Officer.

#### **APPENDIX - 11**

[ See Rule 225 (viii) (b) ]


**FORMULA FOR PRICE VARIATION CLAUSE**

The formula for Price Variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a material element and a labour element.
The figures representing the material element and the labour element should reflect the corresponding proportion
of input costs, while the fixed element may range from 10 to 25%. That portion of the price represented by the fixed
element will not be subject to variation. The portions of the price represented by the material element and labour
element alone will attract Price variation. The formula for Price variation will thus be :

Where P1 is the adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus figure will indicate a reduction in the Contract
Price)
P0 is the Contract Price at the base level.
F is the Fixed element not subject to Price variation.
a is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract price.
b is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price.
L0 and L1 are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the month and year of calculation respectively.
M0 and M1 are the material indices at the base month and year and at the month and year of calculation
respectively.
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element can be broken up into two or three
components such as Mx, My &Mz. Where price variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant
inputs of materials) as for example in getting Technical assistance normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the
price variation formula should have only two elements viz. a high fixed element and a labour element. The fixed
element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending on the mark-up by the supplier of the Periderm rate vis-àvis the wage rates.

**Suggested Framework for Risk assessment of Guarantee proposals**


Ministries/Departments are required to undertake risk assessment of the proposals received from CPSUs
before sending them to Ministry of Finance. Following ratios may be calculated for assessing the risk:

**i) Debt Service Coverage Ratio:** It indicates the ability of a company to use its operating income to repay
all its debt obligations, including repayment of principal and interest on both short-term and long-term debt.


Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortization(EBITDA)

Interest + Principal

|Category A|Category B|
|---|---|
|More than or equal to 1.25|Less than 1.25<br>|



**ii) Current Ratio (CR):** It depicts the ability to meet short-term liabilities from selling short-term assets, and
calculated as under:


Current assets
Current liabilities

|Category A|Category B|
|---|---|
|More than or equal to 1.5|Less than 1.5<br>|



**iii) Debt to Equity Ratio (D/E):** It depicts the ability to pay off debt in future and calculated as under:


Total liabilities
Shareholders’ equity

|Category A|Category B|
|---|---|
|Less than or equal to 1|More than 1<br>|


|Overall Risk Rating|Less than or equal to 1.5|More than 1.5|
|---|---|---|
|**Overall Risk Rating**|**Category A**|**Category B**|



133


Example: The above framework has been illustrated as under:





|Col1|DSCR*|D/E*|CR*|Calculation=<br>Average of<br>(Ratings<br>Assigned)|Overall risk<br>rating|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Company 1**|1.75|0.25|2.10|= 1 (1+1+1)/3)|**Category A**|
|**Company 2**|1.20|1.20|1.50|= 1.67(2+2+1)/3)|**Category B**|
|**Company 3**|0.90|1.80|0.80|= 2 (2+2+2)/3)|**Category B**|


Note: Overall Risk Rating shall be calculated by taking simple mean of all the ratios by assigning 1 and 2 values to
‘A or ‘B’ category.

*Three years’ average ratio may be considered for calculating the overall risk rating.
